When I choose US as country, no data is shown or only after quite a long time. The reason for this is that the flowrunner currently reruns the flow each time you choose a value in that dropdown or other form-controls. When not a lot of processing is needed, you dont notice the problem this causes. But because US has a lot of data, it is very much noticable : network calls are being rerun and a lot of data needs to be processed. The network calls itself also takes some time offcourse, which in this case I got litte control over. I am going to work on a solution to solve the problems on the flowrunner side. An idea is to be able to rerun a single node in a flow with its last payload that it received from an input-node.",
