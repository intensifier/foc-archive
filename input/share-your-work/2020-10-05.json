Something like what the command xp does in Vim on a single line, but that done on multiline is what I intended to achieve with making operations as first class citizen, that is do x (cut) on an operation and then p (paste) on another operation to swap their places. I think that will lead to more exploratory ideas in the system. But since I haven’t interacted with what you have built, there’s a chance that I could be off.
