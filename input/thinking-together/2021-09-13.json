There are conceptually two kinds of errors: sorta expected and recoverable ones (file not found and alike) and unexpected and (practically) unrecoverable (OOM and alike). For the first it's advised to use just regular return values, preferably wrapped into an ADT (aka enum) like `Option`\/`Maybe`, `Result`\/`Either` occasionally custom one. For the second kind it's advised to just \"panic\" (with optional mechanism to still handle the panic if you absolutely required to do so).\n\nAdditionally I'm personally a fan of type systems that make effects explicit, in particular which code can raise errors\/exceptions and which is pure (thus only prone to panics due to unrecoverable hardware\/OS constraints).",
