What is important is that every step ends with a victory, a feeling of success.\nYou list of tasks sounds good! Have you considered maybe keeping them all in the same context? Instead of each step introducing a new kind of app, maybe it could be just a single app that they are improving on in each step? To preserve the context and reduce friction?
