For example, I was never satisfied with the programs I built on my BASIC interpreter because it forced me to hit Enter after pressing a key, where I could see the professional apps respond instantly to any key. I think this instinct is widespread and has basically been leading us all astray. If we just commit to never bundling apps without their development environment, never completely hiding the development environment, I think that one constraint, that commitment to a little less polish and a little more overhead, might have cascading benefits.\n\nWe'll have to fake it till we make it for a while, because clearly there's no market pressure to do this today. \"Forgive them God, for they know not what they do.\"",

For example, I was never satisfied with the programs I built on my BASIC interpreter because it forced me to hit Enter after pressing a key, where I could see the professional apps respond instantly to any key. I think this instinct is widespread and has basically been leading us all astray. If we just commit to never bundling apps without their development environment, never completely hiding the development environment, I think that one constraint, that commitment to a little less polish and a little more overhead, might have cascading benefits.\n\nWe'll have to fake it till we make it for a while, because clearly there's no market pressure to do this today. \"Forgive them God, for they know not what they do.\""
