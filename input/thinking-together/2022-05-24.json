Recipes are difficult for most non-coders to wrestle with because they force a mental model of “do A, then B, then C to hopefully achieve the X that I want”. A recipe by its definition means that the outcome – the thing the user is trying to achieve - is a separate thing, which usually divides the UI into two distinct and somewhat disconnected parts.\n\nThis brings me to outcome-driven coding (ODC). I’m making up this term, surely there is a term grounded in research? :grin: With ODC, we’re flipping the script, and letting users work in a way that follows a pattern of “Tinker and change until it (the outcome, not the recipe) feels right”.\n\nBy mostly hiding the program structure, and showing the outcome of running the program live, an ODC tool can be made on top of an existing programming language, leveraging an entire eco-system of existing work, be it open source, or existing code bases that a product team is working on. This is a big deal for adoption of such a tool, and the foundation for collaboration with developers using IDEs.\n\nThere’s an interesting trade-off here that has to do with expressive power versus complexity in a VPL environment. With ODC, we can manage that complexity by deciding on which parts of a code base that visual programming is best suited for, and which parts to “leave alone but still execute to show the real product outcome”. Parts of a code base are inherently about the human element and the user experience. Let's call this \"design code\". Design code naturally centers on using and defining design system components, the visual language, use of data, navigation flows, and pages. This is where visual programming shines.\n\nThe ODC approach lets us create a tool that is optimized to work with design code visually, in a way that UX designers prefer, while allowing traditional business logic code to execute unhampered inside the tool. The key is to allow collaboration on a single shared code base, with tools specialized for the unique skills and needs of the people in a cross-functional team.\n\nWould be great to hear what this group thinks of this hybrid approach, and whether there is existing work that is similar.

This is a big deal for adoption of such a tool, and the foundation for collaboration with developers using IDEs.\n\nThere’s an interesting trade-off here that has to do with expressive power versus complexity in a VPL environment. With ODC, we can manage that complexity by deciding on which parts of a code base that visual programming is best suited for, and which parts to “leave alone but still execute to show the real product outcome”. Parts of a code base are inherently about the human element and the user experience. Let's call this \"design code\". Design code naturally centers on using and defining design system components, the visual language, use of data, navigation flows, and pages. This is where visual programming shines.\n\nThe ODC approach lets us create a tool that is optimized to work with design code visually, in a way that UX designers prefer, while allowing traditional business logic code to execute unhampered inside the tool. The key is to allow collaboration on a single shared code base, with tools specialized for the unique skills and needs of the people in a cross-functional team.\n\nWould be great to hear what this group thinks of this hybrid approach, and whether there is existing work that is similar.
