Sometimes we modify the behavior of the system by having the algorithm change its own code while running. Okay, code is also data.\n\nIf we implement the naive B-tree algorithm, the shape (and thus performance) of the constructed B-tree depends entirely on the entropy present in the sequence of keys we insert into it. In this situation the B-Tree compiles a tiny state machine from the \"code\" of the input keys. Okay, data is also code.\n\n<https:\/\/zoo.cs.yale.edu\/classes\/cs112\/2012-spring\/helpdoc\/pike.html|This> old Rob Pike quote also regards this matter:\n\n&gt; Code and data _are_ the same, or at least they can be.

Is the software at hand supposed to be a concrete product providing a reliable experience, or is it a fluid process for experimenting toward experiences we haven't imagined yet? In \"The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet\", Alan Kay talked about Squeak as a tool to help you build the next version of itself. In contrast, he says that commercial Smalltalk didn't change much once it was released. It's difficult to build software products with a moving foundation. I think there's a fundamental tension between (r)evolutionary software-as-process and commercial software-as-product.
