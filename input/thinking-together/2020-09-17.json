When using emacs this way, one writes code all the time with the intent to use it and then throw it away. This attitude requires trust in one's tools and processes that whatever is being done won't take very long or be very difficult -- that it doesn't involve a \"development process\" in the methodological sense. Once more I say: do not accept compile-run-debug cycles in your life, make your medium a partner that grants you flow.\n\nLastly, I thought I'd add something quick I livecoded to help me accomplish a specific task, but that is not a script. I needed to edit some video and found the UIs of most systems to be wretched, so I took a few minutes to build the scrubber I wanted (a series of strips representing sufficient difference between frames to give scene navigation). The workflow allowed both direct manipulation _and_ programmatic interaction from within emacs at the same time.",
