Crash-only programs are designed to always be able to recover gracefully from a reboot. There's a fundamental tension here, and I'm starting to realize I'm very definitely on one side of it. I like a neat desk, and am compulsively closing things (terminals, browser tabs, browser sessions) when I'm done with them. I prefer text editors to IDEs, vim to emacs, unix as my IDE rather than slime. I'd always thought of these as subjective opinions that were just down to my personality and past experience. But, upon reflection, I want to make a stronger case that \"my side\" is superior.\n\n1. Focusing on recovering from reboots makes you better at simulating immortality. Restarts can in principle become instantaneous. Focusing on never rebooting makes you worse at recovering from crashes.\n2. It's easy for immortal programs to end up in situations that are difficult to reproduce. I spent some time recently programming with <@UE1JQM9HQ>'s Glamorous Toolkit. Modern Smalltalk uncomfortably straddles the image and git repo worlds. The way you work is to make changes to your running image until you have something you like, then go back and package up a slice of your image into a git repository to publish. If you make mistakes, others can have trouble reproducing the behavior you created in your image. Testing if you did it right necessarily requires rebooting the image.\nPutting these reasons together, immortal systems are more forbidding to newcomers. Crashing becomes a traumatic event, one newcomers are not used to, something beginner tutorials don't cover. When things don't work, it's more challenging to ask for help. Creating and sharing reproducible test cases requires crash-recovery skills.\n\nRereading the Pinocchio post now, I notice that there's actually no concrete benefits stated for long-lived programs. All there is are (compelling) analogies. A counter-analogy: an immortal program is like a spaceship. Once launched you're in a little bubble, stuck with whoever you happened to start out with. A crash-only program is like a little stone rolling down a hillside, gathering other stones until it turns into an avalanche.\n\nAs I said above, I'm biased because of my experiences. I'm curious to hear from others with more experience of immortal programs. Am I understating the benefits, overstating the drawbacks?",
