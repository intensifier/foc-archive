I think we can make it practical for end users with technical aptitude to make apps.\n\nI should have been more clear. I think it is possible to provide end-users with an environment that allows them to build custom tools. I was trying to argue that the main problem isn’t that people cannot program because it’s too hard. The main problem I see is that most of our programming environments are made for building professional software that will be used by thousands to millions of users.\nI think programming should be easier, but first I want to focus on a better shape for software that enables casual remixes and recombination of tools. Boxer [1] is a good example for such an environment.\n\n<@UCUSW7WVD> Thanks for linking back to previous conversations. I think the future of coding history tool is a great example of the kind of tools I’m talking about. In my dream world, something like this wouldn’t require writing any code at all, and you could just take apart the slack interface to create a custom view.\n\n[1] <https:\/\/boxer-project.github.io\/>",

I think we can make it practical for end users with technical aptitude to make apps.\n\nI should have been more clear. I think it is possible to provide end-users with an environment that allows them to build custom tools. I was trying to argue that the main problem isn’t that people cannot program because it’s too hard. The main problem I see is that most of our programming environments are made for building professional software that will be used by thousands to millions of users.\nI think programming should be easier, but first I want to focus on a better shape for software that enables casual remixes and recombination of tools. Boxer [1] is a good example for such an environment.\n\n"
