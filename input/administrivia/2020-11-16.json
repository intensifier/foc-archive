Longer updates, or discussion of past work, goes in <#CCL5VVBAN|share-your-work>.\nBoth of these keep the name `#two-minute-week` relevant. Other changes to the format (allowing longer updates, or posts about older work, or more frequent updates) would strain the name, which seems needless — we have <#CCL5VVBAN|share-your-work> as a fallback, so there's no harm in keeping <#C0120A3L30R|two-minute-week> narrowly defined.\n\nMy preference is probably just to keep things as they are, since that's less of a make-work project.
