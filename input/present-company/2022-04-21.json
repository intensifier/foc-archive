My main criticism is that they are aiming for a grand society-level project but have been doing their work in secret for so long. In my experience, the longer you stay away from your target audience, the more your direction is divorced from their needs. I'm sure the folks at Dynamicland know this, but that's why I'm really really curious as to how they are addressing this concern of mine. I guess we'll see one day.",
