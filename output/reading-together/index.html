On the latest episode we talked about Doug Engelbart’s Augmenting Human Intellect.<br/><br/>This is a massive work. It offers a lot to think about, but also a lot of complications. While incredibly innovative, Engelbart’s work was grounded in many of the ideas of his time; the neo-wharfian hypothesis, the emphasis on logic and argumentation. What lessons can we learn from it? What things did it get wrong?<br/><br/>I think reading the paper critically does pay dividends, but definitely be ready to spend a lot of time to gain these insights.

“<em>Supporting Visual Artists in Programming through Direct Inspection and Control of Program Execution</em>” by Jingyi Li, Joel Brandt, Radomir Mech, Maneesh Agrawala, &amp; Jennifer Jacobs<br/><br/>&gt; Programming offers new opportunities for visual art creation, but understanding and manipulating the abstract representations that make programming powerful can pose challenges for artists who are accustomed to manual tools and concrete visual interaction. We hypothesize that we can reduce these barriers through programming environments that link state to visual artwork output. We created Demystified Dynamic Brushes (DDB), a tool that bidirectionally links code, numerical data, and artwork across the programming interface and the execution environment-i.e., the artist's in-progress artwork. DDB automatically records stylus input as artists draw, and stores a history of brush state and output in relation to the input. This structure enables artists to inspect current and past numerical input, state, and output and control program execution through the direct selection of visual geometric elements in the drawing canvas. An observational study suggests that artists engage in program inspection when they can visually access geometric state information on the drawing canvas in the process of manual drawing.<br/><a href="https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/publication/DDB">https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/publication/DDB</a>

Title: Technical Dimensions of Programming Systems<br/>Authors: Joel Jakubovic, Jonathan Edwards, and Tomas Petricek<br/>(who I <em>think</em> are <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Joel Jakubovic</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> and <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Tomas Petricek</span>, respectively)<br/><br/>This is still in review afaik, but it’s just too much of a gem for this community to wait until that’s done. If one of the authors has information about the latest revisions I’d love to know more!<br/><br/>from the abstract:<br/>&gt; Many programming systems go beyond programming languages. Programming is usually done in the context of a stateful environment, beyond just writing code, by interacting with a system through a graphical user interface. Much research effort focuses on building programming systems that are easier to use, accessible to non-experts, moldable and/or powerful, but such efforts are often disconnected. They are informal, guided by the personal vision of the authors and thus are only evaluable and comparable on the basis of individual experience using them. They fail to form a coherent body of research, since it is unclear how to build on past work. In the research world, much has been said and done that allows comparison of <em>programming languages</em>, yet no similar theory exists for <em>programming systems</em>; we believe that programming systems deserve a theory too.<br/>This paper was one of the most exciting pieces of research I’ve discovered in the last year, can’t recommend it enough! Attached is a PDF of the paper (a version of it at least) and a great single-page table (explored in detail later in the paper) which should convey some of why this is such a good fit for our community.

“Meaningful Modeling: What’s the Semantics of ‘Semantics’?” by Harel. On the importance of clear semantics for visual and modeling programming languages:<br/><br/>&gt;  In general, people tend to take diagrams too lightly, finding it difficult to consider a collection of graphics serious enough to be a language and profound enough to be the real thing. Perhaps the blame lies with the early failure of visual programming techniques to replace conventional programming languages. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As a result, we often see the doodling phenomenon—a mindset that says diagrams are what an engineer scribbles on the back of a napkin, but the real work is done with textual languages.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Sadly, too many language designers and methodologists share this view. Some find it difficult to understand why we can’t simply add more graphical notations to a visual formalism without spoiling an easy to understand semantics by introducing special cases or concept combinations that contradict each other. For example, in private communication, people have proposed all kinds of extensions to statecharts, such as (actual quotes) a new kind of arrow that “means synchronization” and a new kind of box that “means separate-thread concurrency.”<br/>&gt; <br/><a href="https://researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard-Rumpe/publication/2956210_Meaningful_modeling_What's_the_semantics_of_semantics/links/0046352323cd69519a000000/Meaningful-modeling-Whats-the-semantics-of-semantics.pdf">https://researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard-Rumpe/publication/2956210_Meaningful_modeli[…]000/Meaningful-modeling-Whats-the-semantics-of-semantics.pdf</a>

Man Computer Symbiosis - J.C.R. Licklider (<a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf">http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider%20-%20Man-Computer%20Symbiosis.pdf</a>)<br/><br/>In our first series of episodes going through some papers (<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/055</a>) we discuss man-computer symbiosis.<br/><br/>If I were to put together a list of the most influential papers in computer science this would definitely make the list. The paper is really the first paper that imagines personal computing. While it may not have predicting everyone owning a computer. It definitely imagined a future that looks quite similar to the one we have today.<br/><br/>I think the other striking thing about this paper is just how practically minded it was. It says a large vision, but also talks about a way to achieve it. In some ways it feels mundane today, but I think this mundanity is actually its virtue. If you are looking for a paper to learn from for proposing your own idea in the future of coding, this is a great paper to consider. <br/><br/>Definitely worth a read

Also started reading through “Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: a ‘cognitive dimensions’ framework” by Green and Petre (1996).<br/><br/>&gt; The dimensions in outline: The list of dimensions that we shall use in this paper follows. For each dimension we supply a thumb-nail description. A lengthier account of the dimension and its relation to the underlying evidence will be found in the appropriate section below.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; • <b>Abstraction Gradient</b>: What are the minimum and maximum levels of abstraction? Can fragments be encapsulated?<br/>&gt; • <b>Closeness of mapping</b>: What ‘programming games’ need to be learned?<br/>&gt; • <b>Consistency</b>: When some of the language has been learnt, how much of the rest can be inferred?<br/>&gt; • <b>Diffuseness</b>: How many symbols or graphic entities are required to express a meaning?<br/>&gt; • <b>Error-proneness</b>: Does the design of the notation induce ‘careless mistakes’?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hard mental operations</b>: Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or pen- cilled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?<br/>&gt; • <b>Hidden dependencies</b>: Is every dependency overtly indicated in both directions? Is the indi- cation perceptual or only symbolic?<br/>&gt; • <b>Premature commitment</b>: Do programmers have to make decisions before they have the information they need?<br/>&gt; • <b>Progressive evaluation</b>: Can a partially-complete program be executed to obtain feedback on “How am I doing”?<br/>&gt; • <b>Role-expressiveness</b>: Can the reader see how each component of a program relates to the whole?<br/>&gt; • <b>Secondary notation</b>: Can programmers use layout, colour, or other cues to convey extra meaning, above and beyond the ‘official’ semantics of the language?<br/>&gt; • <b>Viscosity</b>: How much effort is required to perform a single change?<br/>&gt; • <b>Visibility</b>: Is every part of the code simultaneously visible (assuming a large enough display), or is it at least possible to juxtapose any two parts side-by-side at will? If the code is dispersed, is it at least possible to know in what order to read it?<br/><a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-papers/CogDimsPaper.pdf">https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/CS589and584/CS589-papers/CogDimsPaper.pdf</a>

A book called “<em>Diagramming Techniques for Analysts and Programmers”</em> (1985). Found it through a paper by David Harel. He descibed it as: <br/><br/>&gt; The state of the art on diagrammatic languages at the time can be gleaned from the book by Martin and McClure titled <em>Diagramming Techniques for Analysts and Programmers</em>. This book discussed many visual techniques, but little attention was given to the need for solid semantics and/or executability. Curiously, this book could have helped convince people that visual languages should not be taken seriously as means to actually program a system the way a standard programming language can.<br/>&gt; <br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/diagrammingtechn00mart/page/310/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/diagrammingtechn00mart/page/310/mode/2up</a>

My first entry here is “How do Committees Invent” by Melvin Conway. If you are familiar with Conway’s Law, this is the paper that introduced it to the world. If you aren’t, Conway’s law is the following<br/><br/>&gt; Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.<br/><br/>Before reading the paper, I had never considered the way in which Conway’s law impacts not only software, but any system designed at a company. <br/><br/>The paper is short and incredibly convincing. The hierarchical workplace organization is almost always a structural mismatch for how we want our software to be. Further, it is rigid in a way we almost never desire for our software. Given Conway’s Law, if we want better software, should we be coming up with better organizational theories? Honestly, I think so.<br/><br/>He ends by asking how we can avoid this problem and says this <br/><br/>&gt; Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible.<br/><br/>It is so sad to me that today people would think this meant agile, when in fact, agile is one of the very things holding us back from addressing this issue head on. &lt;/controversial-opinion&gt;<br/><br/>Highly recommend reading even if you feel you already know Conway’s law.

<b>Title</b> — <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2661136.2661154">In Search of Types</a><br/><b>Author</b> — <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4GHlcNoAAAAJ">Stephen Kell</a><br/><br/><b>Abstract</b><br/>The concept of “type” has been used without a consistent, precise definition in discussions about programming languages for 60 years. In this essay I explore various concepts lurking behind distinct uses of this word, highlighting two traditions in which the word came into use largely independently: engineering traditions on the one hand, and those of symbolic logic on the other. These traditions are founded on differing attitudes to the nature and purpose of abstraction, but their distinct uses of “type” have never been explicitly unified. One result is that discourse <em>across</em> these traditions often finds itself at cross purposes, such as <em>overapplying</em> one sense of “type” where another is appropriate, and occasionally proceeding to draw wrong conclusions. I illustrate this with examples from well-known and justly well-regarded literature, and argue that ongoing developments in both the theory and practice of programming make now a good time to resolve these problems.<br/><br/><b>What I Like</b><br/>Kell is a very salient writer and thinker and this paper in particular helped disambiguate the notions of “type” in a way that’s been useful for my thinking. He first breaks out “data types” from “type disciplines” and explores the essential properties of both, I find this two-part distinction useful, but his deconstruction of “data types” in particular was insightful and I highly recommend at least skimming through that section for anyone working on programming systems.
