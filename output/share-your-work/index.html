Hey all,<br/>we’ve made some more progress on <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">Wasp</a> lately and added a few bigger features (e.g. running async jobs/workers - <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement">https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement</a>) so wanted to share with the community here :slightly_smiling_face:.<br/><br/>Since we’re moving towards Beta and plan to release in a couple of months, we’d also appreciate your feedback - we’re running a small Alpha Testing Program (takes ~45mins + we tried to make it fun :D) and would be thrilled to get your thoughts and ideas on how we can make Wasp better :slightly_smiling_face:. You can find more details and apply here: <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82">https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82</a><br/><br/>Thanks a lot and honored to be a part of the community!

Hello all, I have been building a visual editor for compound graph datasets: <a href="https://grapheralpha.netlify.app/">https://grapheralpha.netlify.app/</a><br/><br/>Compound graphs are those where nodes have two kinds of connections: Adjacency and Inclusion. I.e. A node can be a child of another node - in addition to having other kind of edges.<br/>Cytoscape JS is great at visualizing such graphs, but I couldn’t find a visual editor for these kind of datasets. This is NOT a diagram-editor for which there are plenty of choices (like TLDraw or Excalidraw).<br/><br/>This is built with SVG and Svelte and works completely in the browser. I will be open-sourcing it in the coming weeks.

I've updated webcode so that owners of endpoints can configure "public livecoding", which allows any logged in user to grab the public traffic to that endpoint (well, each logged in user gets their own fingerprinted endpoint, so traffix is not mixed between users). So finally I can write a public demo of livecoding. This article is maybe too long but its how to implement a webserver including: serving and responding to web forms, serving a dynamic image (e.g. dashboard), and streamed responses.<br/><br/>webcode offers a fairly low level HTTP interface so achieving most of those things requires a fair amount of HTTP knowledge, hence I thought I would just write it up.<br/><br/><a href="https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/livecode">https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/livecode</a>

Hej. Glad to have found this community I think it's what I have been looking for for a while. I'm super interested in end user programming. (That seems like a good future of coding topic, or does anyone know a specific "end user programming" community)<br/><br/>Over the last year I have built my own language and structured editor. Pushing the idea of how much can a compiler tell you about your program. The idea is to have a really small AST, there are about 10 different nodes. Because it so small writing new static analysis tools should be easy, it's also really easy to target new environments. i.e. it took me about an hour to write a to Javascript. To keep it small I've made some unusual choices, for one the language contains type provider but not numbers. I keep a dev log of 3-8 minute long videos on various topics. <a href="https://petersaxton.uk/log/">https://petersaxton.uk/log/</a><br/>Beyond that it's not really usable to anyone else (I haven't documented the keys for the editor so the only way to start is by referring to the source) That might change at somepoint, but I don't know when.

Hi,<br/>those of you who follow me on Twitter have probably already seen this, but recently a friend encouraged me to share it here as well.<br/><br/>For some time, I've been working on a graphical Scheme programming environment that I have called GRASP (which stands for "GRAphical Scheme Programming").<br/><br/>Currently I am doing fourth prototype (which I hope will become the production version), which - as I imagine - should work in text terminals as well as on graphical displays.<br/><br/>But by far, the third prototype was the most mature, and (at least in my opinion) the most pleasant to use.<br/><br/>GRASP is intended to work natively on mobile devices, and the third prototype was written in Java entirely on my phone (using the Termux environment).<br/><br/>I have recorded a few videos showing the touch interface to GRASP. For example, here's a demo which shows the definition of factorial<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0YNZCO7gyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0YNZCO7gyQ</a><br/><br/>and here's another one, which shows how a screen can be splitted:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKxKRIvCpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCKxKRIvCpU</a><br/><br/>I am mentioning this, because I think that - even though I do not develop it anymore - it wasn't actually that far from being useful software: it lets the user open files (supporting the basic part of the s-expression syntax) and save them as well, so with some patience it could be used for doing some "real" work.<br/><br/>The main problem is that newly-created files are saved in the app's "internal storage", whereas the file browser can only open files from "external storage". This shouldn't be hard to solve, however, so if anyone's interested, the code is available at<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/panicz/grasp-android/tree/master/stages">https://github.com/panicz/grasp-android/tree/master/stages</a><br/><br/>The <tt>stage5' directory contains a plain s-expression editor, and the </tt>stage6' directory additionally includes the Kawa Scheme implementation and lets one evaluate the Scheme expressions (the drawback is that it takes significantly longer to build).<br/><br/>Some Scheme features that are missing from both the parser and representation (and would be hard to add to this prototype) include:<br/>- dotted lists<br/>- strings<br/>- comments<br/>- vectors<br/>- quote/quasiquote/unquote etc. abbreviations (the abbreviations accidentally work in Kawa when they're used on symbols, but if the abbreviating characters were placed in front of opening parentheses, they'd be treated just as regular symbols)<br/><br/>Also, there are some bugs related to positioning, but I wasn't really trying to fix them, given that I started a new prototype from scratch.<br/><br/>The currently developed prototype can be found in the <tt>retreat/GRASP</tt> directory in the same repository. It is written in Kawa Scheme (but it requires an unreleased<br/>version of Kawa built from the tip of their repository), and it currently only works in text terminals.<br/><br/>And I think that "works" is a slight exaggeration here. It is capable of parsing more Scheme syntax (including three types of comments, dotted lists and strings - though vectors and quote abbreviations still aren't supported).<br/><br/>It also features a cursor that is supposed to work roughly as in the regular text editors.<br/><br/>It uses a more classical representation of s-expressions, namely - good old cons-cells. (The information about whitespace and comments is stored in weak-key hash tables)<br/><br/>In order to run this prototype, it's sufficient to run "./editor" (provided that a proper build of Kawa is available somewhere in the path - and that also requires a JVM).<br/><br/>However, the "taste" of the editor can be obtained from the following "unit-test suite" (which doesn't yet pass, but should give a rough idea of the experience that I'm aiming at)<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/panicz/grasp-android/blob/master/stages/retreat/GRASP/src/test-writing-map.scm">https://github.com/panicz/grasp-android/blob/master/stages/retreat/GRASP/src/test-writing-map.scm</a><br/><br/>Unfortunately none of those prototypes conveys the full spectrum of ideas that I'm trying to pursue. One important aspect was captured by the first prototype, the one that I wrote in Racket:<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/oxeB-8k-DBA?t=33">https://youtu.be/oxeB-8k-DBA?t=33</a><br/><br/>The demo shows (around seconds 35-45) a custom representation for graphs that can be used as an alternative to s-expressions.<br/><br/>Of course the key idea isn't to represent graphs, but to be able to provide custom visual representations/interactions of any data structure.<br/><br/>(This idea has recently been pursued by Leif Andersen, who calls it "visual interactive syntax", and implemented that as an extension to the dr Racket IDE as well as a browser based IDE for Clojure available at <a href="https://visr.pl/">https://visr.pl/</a>)<br/><br/>In many ways, GRASP also seems similar to Boxer (that I learned about relatively recently), but to be honest, my greatest source of inspiration so far has been Emacs and the experience it provides for working with various Lisps, as well as its self-introspection capabilities.

I made a url-based game where you take care of emojis that live inside your url bar: <a href="https://linkians.com">https://linkians.com</a>.<br/>It's like Sims but it's a 1 dimensional world of emojis. The game state is entirely contained in the url path so that you can at any point copy the url and save/share it, or edit it however you want to start the game from a different state. For example you could start from any of these links:<br/>• <a href="https://linkians.com/🌴<em>😘😀</em>_">https://linkians.com/🌴<em>😘😀</em>_</a><br/>• <a href="https://linkians.com/<em>🌴🧘🌴</em>__😀<em>">https://linkians.com/</em>🌴🧘🌴<em></em>_😀_</a><br/>• <a href="https://linkians.com/🌴<em>🕺🔊😅</em>_">https://linkians.com/🌴<em>🕺🔊😅</em>_</a><br/>I know this isn't pushing coding forward necessarily, but is an experiment in terms of user hackable game state and storage systems. I wanted to make a game where the game "server" has no logic and stores no state. The user can completely control the state of the game and save/edit/share it with just a human readable link. It's a work in progress, I'd love feedback!<br/>(cc <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mark Christian</span>)

Here is a new video with the progress of my code explorer project. It only works with js files, but it's using <tt>tree-sitter</tt> for parsing, so it just needs adding other grammars to add support for other languages.<br/>If anyone has an interesting gist of functional code with many small functions that will be a good example code to explore, please share it with me :pray:

Given that Henosia reasons about code (React + TypeScript in our case), it can measure spacing on the canvas when you wrap elements in a new Stack, setting the new spacing prop so layers stay put. This blurs the lines between the running program and the source code, but it just feels right to do UX design this way. Not sure what to call this. Maybe "spacing-aware coding" :thinking_face::grin:

Future of Coding • Episode 56<br/>Doug Engelbart • Augmenting Human Intellect<br/><br/>I mean, what is there to say. This is a bit like Mt. Everest. Engelbart is one of the most central figures in our community. This is one of his most important works, arguably more important than the Mother of All Demos. It's also... really... well... it filled me with feelings.

I've been building an editor for plain text where you can also seamlessly insert line drawings.<br/><br/><a href="http://akkartik.name/lines.html">http://akkartik.name/lines.html</a><br/><br/>The link doesn't get into it because I don't expect people coming to the product for the first time to care, but I've paid at least as much attention to making it hackable as usable. Easy to build, uses a platform that is also easy to build, lots of tests in the Mu style if you look inside the source.

I’ve been working on this canvas tool for thinking with video for nearly a year. It’s built around the premise that videotext (time-aligned transcripts for videos) can serve as an intermediary between the analytic potential of text and the intimacy of orality. Excited to get it out of beta and in front of more users!<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/tobyshooters/status/1532108991114924036?s=20&amp;t=Xjn71ln3-xfSOdA-rwqAZA">https://twitter.com/tobyshooters/status/1532108991114924036?s=20&amp;t=Xjn71ln3-xfSOdA-rwqAZA</a>

This isn’t super “futuristic” but it is work that I did in my spare time that I’m proud of and I think points in a general future direction.  I even end the tweet thread with a meta note about the future.<br/><br/>I spent my spare time building a visualizer for the new ruby JIT named YJIT. You can check the thread for details, but I did this primarily as a learning experience and it was a great one. I think all code bases deserve a visualization. But today those are hard, hence my meta note.<br/><br/>Here I’ll be more direct on the meta point. I think visual programming is awesome. But we can’t leave all the nice things to new languages or wall gardens like smalltalk. We need environments that let us visualize the workings of existing codebases. I don’t think a one size fits all visualization is ever the answer. We need to be able to build visualizations at a higher level of abstraction for our codebases. We need to be able to see the entities of our codebases and how they relate. We need to be able to keep past values of our running programs around. We need an environment that can help us do this regardless of which language we are in.<br/><br/>In every size-able codebase I work in I make my own bespoke visualizer. But doing that is tedious and relies on extensive experience building frontends. Does it need to be that way? I think not.<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyhmiller/status/1531638254264541185">https://twitter.com/jimmyhmiller/status/1531638254264541185</a>

Hey folks, I wanna show you  something new we have been working on - an <b>AI code review bot</b> :robot_face:. Most pull requests (about 2/3) get merged without corrections, and the idea is to have the bot detect and approve them. This was born out frustration constantly waiting for 'code review' for small and safe code contribution, especially since I believe in "ship small &amp; often. Also it allows you to focus on the trickier changes instead.<br/><br/>:point_right: Here's how it works: anybody can do a 'historical' test on any repository here - <a href="https://codeball.ai/">https://codeball.ai/</a> to test out the accuracy. To do reviews on new pull requests, it's setup as a GitHub action.<br/>I'd love to hear what you smart people think! Happy to also share more about the model too (basically it's a neural net, the inputs include features about the code, the author and author experience with the code changed, trained on over 1M code contributions).

Curious about what this group thinks of the approach we're taking with <a href="https://www.henosia.com/">https://www.henosia.com/</a> We provide direct manipulation of the visual output of a running program, and think this is a great fit for UX Designers where their intent is "move that", "adjust this whitespace" and "insert a button below". It's visual TypeScript code editing in real time for designers. Oh, and we have multiplayer in the mix, which has been, let's call it <em>interesting</em>, so far :joy:

Hi all, I've got an update on the Mech language ready to go live. I thought I'd post it here first to get some eyes and feedback if possible: <a href="http://mech-lang.org/post/2022-05-20-spring-update/">http://mech-lang.org/post/2022-05-20-spring-update/</a><br/><br/>I've only just finished writing it last night so I've got some proofreading to do myself. But there are a lot of cool videos in there so I hope you'll check it out and let me know what you think!

Hello Future of Coding community, I have finally had time to put together a draft of a concept I've had for a few months now - ReadableScript is a very simple 'javascript virtual machine language' that uses assembly-like syntax. Would love any and all feedback, do you think this could be a more accessible style of programming for beginners? Also as it's a "vm" it may be well suited to low-code programming environments. My next milestone goal is to integrate the language into a REPL. Note that this is a very rough draft, you can't even make strings! But the concept should be clear.<br/><br/><a href="https://readablescript.com/">https://readablescript.com/</a>

For a couple years, I keep returning to ideas of composability, remix-ability, coding in small pieces, getting to snap them together and apart fluidly, like legos, and with lots of collaborators. This is what excites me about functional programming, how it lends itself to abstractions that compose really well. However I was recently inspired by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@JP Posma</span> to throw elegant composability out of the window and simply enable coding in the small by appending small programs together...<br/><br/>...and what we came up with is called <b>twittereval</b>. The idea is you add the words "eval" to a tweet's URL and then we evaluate it (and all the tweets above it or referenced) as JavaScript. It's obviously silly but also kinda neat, and I thought it would be thought provoking to this community. Excited to hear what ideas and suggestions you guys have! I'd also really love it if anyone tried it out and made anything cool :)<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1523449402009948160">https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1523449402009948160</a>

We'll be reading a number of papers from the history of our field, ranging from the beloved classics we all know by heart, to obscure and mysterious potential alternate histories that never came to be, and perhaps — perhaps! — one or two papers that really deserve nothing more than to wrap a dead fish. First up, squarely in the <em>beloved</em> camp, a classic from "Licky" himself.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this episode — the paper was a fun read, and I think that really came through in our discussion. Also, I want to personally thank Jimmy for suggesting we do this together (and then patiently waiting for 9 months for me to finish Crosscut). I think this will breathe new life into the podcast, and help me keep new episodes coming out at a regular clip in the gaps where I'm too overwhelmed with <b> gestures everywhere </b> to do interviews.

Last week, Ink &amp; Switch published the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/">Crosscut</a> essay, which describes our (<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Szymon Kaliski</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Marcel Goethals</span>, and my) work on a prototype tool for drawing dynamic models of your thoughts. It's a fount of FoC-relevant ideas. For instance, combining <em>the place where the programming happens</em> with <em>the place where the program runs,</em> but even further <em>using the same tools for building and working inside the program.</em> Also, Crosscut tries to <em>not feel like programming</em>, and present a minimalist interface that is ruthlessly focused on emulating the best aspects of traditional pen &amp; paper. If you haven't taken the time to read the essay, you're.. probably busy, I shouldn't bother you, sorry. I'll just leave a note on the door.<br/><br/>Before working on Crosscut, I had been slowly chipping away at my own FoC project called <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-time-travel/">Hest</a> (yeah, still just that one blog post). I also made a podcast just to think out loud about the project, so that I could self-reflect and thus hone my ideas and goals, and maybe someday build another prototype. But when the Crosscut project started, it drew all my attention, and the podcast stopped.<br/><br/>Today, with Crosscut done and released to the world, I'm here to share a new Hest podcast episode — 46 minutes long — in which I compare and contrast Crosscut and Hest.<br/>• How are their prototypes similar and different?<br/>• What goals do they share and disagree on?<br/>• How has my work on Crosscut shaped my thoughts on visual programming generally?<br/>• What effect will that have as I continue pursuing Hest (or any other FoC projects)?<br/>To find out, kindly use <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss">this hand-crafted RSS feed</a>, search for <b>Hest</b> or <b>Ivan Reese</b> in your podcast player of choice, or click one of the buttons here: <a href="https://pod.link/1559446316">https://pod.link/1559446316</a><br/><br/>And stay tuned for more episodes. They won't be on a schedule, but they will be about as relevant and entertaining as this fine slack message. So, fifty-fifty, eh? ;)

Hey muchaches, I've been quietly consuming the newsletter&amp;podcast these months...errr..years (thankslots Steve, Mariano, Ivan and all of you for the inputs+inspiration!) while slowly working on my side-project: <a href="https://github.com/Gregoor/tofu">Tofu</a>. When thinking of this community, I always place Tofu as more of an attempt at the near-future-of-programming. It does not aim for revolution as much as many of the cool things here (booo incrementalism boo boo).<br/><br/>Anyway, after years of working on it and using it on my own, I want to slowly start letting people in and this community is prime for me there. It is currently an experimental extension for VSCode for structurally yet fluidly editing JS &amp; TS. If you don't have VSCode installed, you can also use it within your browser <a href="https://vscode.dev/github/Gregoor/vscode-tofu-starter/index.ts">here</a> (there should be a pop-up asking if you want to install the Tofu extension). If you do have VSCode, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=watware.tofu-vscode">here's a link to the extension in the marketplace</a>.<br/><br/>Feedback of all kinds wanted and welcome (here or over in the <a href="https://github.com/Gregoor/tofu/issues">GH issues</a>)!

I have been dogfooding my literate programming tool wheel. So far I have been able to develop multiple webapps, a game and even a C++ based desktop app with it. I also think LP can be invaluable in managing your programming notes and system admin commands, not to mention writing html based books. You can checkout all the project links <a href="https://xyzzyapps.link/literate-programming.html">here</a>.<br/><br/>I dub my approach to LP as procedural literate programming. Instead of developing new syntax, I use string substitution based approaches common in web development which is more flexible than all the other approaches to literate programming so far, including the original cweb.<br/><br/>I think the fundamental mistake that people seem to be making with LP is using it to describe algorithms rather than code history, code inspirations, bug stories, features and any other context surrounding code like tests / security. This means that git commit messages can be skipped with LP in some sense. While complex algorithms definitely can use lengthy descriptions, you can assume your reader is a programmer and just show code as is for everyday code. I suppose if you want to keep existing ways of  working with code you can copy paste the diffs manually back into the literate source code, but a well integrated IDE could perhaps avoid this step and allow you to use both workflows simultaneously.<br/><br/>Last year I participated in a few jams which allowed me to explore different approaches to LP. I have developed a comment based code extraction and animation approach to LP called Loom and I was able to develop a very basic IDE using PyQt.  It turns out that LP has a lot in common with Xanadu and Web because fundamentally they all are hypertext systems. Talk about a wild coincidence! Like Xanadu, LP is heavily dependent on two-way links called transclusions. If anyone knows Ted Nelson here I would love to tell him about my findings about how a transclusion based browser can act as an IDE to LP.<br/><br/>I also found that LP can act a glue tool for generative programming. You can create multiple DSLs and pipe them through external scripts, while presenting just the DSL to the reader. This is something I am exploring in a compiler project where I am trying to generate C code from YAML.<br/><br/>As of now I think LP is a huge plus  for solo developers juggling multiple projects. Reading code in an understandable order allows you to pick up code where you left off. No wonder Knuth was so productive with it. You can checkout demos for wheel, PyQt IDE and Loom on youtube. I have also created a screencast recently to showcase my workflow with sublime<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bcaif2h1lE&amp;list=PLbyPZ-v56IPnTDISg3pFUYl7374q7jqsq">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bcaif2h1lE&amp;list=PLbyPZ-v56IPnTDISg3pFUYl7374q7jqsq</a>

So the AI tarot reading app is done: <a href="https://thetarot.online/index.html">https://thetarot.online/index.html</a><br/>It has been programmed entirely within Observable. Production traffic is routed through the developers notebook if you have it open, so you can observe the system live. I exploit observables dataflow so each step of the processing pipeline is cached, so you can see exactly where a problem occurred, and thanks to hot code reload, you can fix a bug and have the pipeline continue without rerunning prior steps allowing easy iterative programming workflows. Of course, because Observable notebooks are executing Javascript, you can attach a debugger too (even programmatically)<br/>One click forkable, MIT licensed.<br/><br/>This is what I think the future of software development should look like. But I am struggling to communicate this well. The idea is to make cloud programming feel local, to exclusively test in prod, because when you are hitting third party APIs its a waste of effort mocking a staging environment, or a local environment. I want to remove the thick layers of indirection in the development process that no longer make sense. Forget git, forget toolchains, just straight to prod using modern Javascript, debugged with the authoritative debuggers built into browsers.

Another Clerk demo!

One can write mathematical functions in Clojure that are graphed in Clerk with automatic translation of functions from source code to typeset mathematics using KaTex.

A student did a presentation yesterday about his work on Mech, and he surprised me by giving what amounted to one of the most detailed looks into Mech so far. I turned his presentation in to a little video attached below. Keep in mind, Mech is still very early and there's no error messages, yet he demoed this in one take live in front of the class. It's the programming-demo equivalent to pitching a no hitter imo. I was very impressed! If anyone out there has job openings consider Haocheng!<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNvTTd6rp3w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNvTTd6rp3w</a>

long time lurker here, but the last post on webassembly convinced me to post this :slightly_smiling_face: We recently built an application to analyze and explore single-cell rna-seq data fully in the browser using webassembly.

I'm starting a series of blog posts covering the "History of No-code", the idea is to bring together this new interest in "Non Fregean Programming" closer to its history and theory.  (the opposite of fregean according to Pygmalion is analogical, which I find to be an overloaded term to use)<br/><br/>The first post is about Pygmalion (1975), the next one will be on an older but non-visual one. Trying to find where the limit of No-code lies :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/><a href="https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/">https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/</a>

I would like to share with you Sturdy - a new, <b>real-time version control</b> platform, specifically made for work. Pull requests were designed for an open source workflow, and I think tooling can be way better in a team setting (eg. folks that do standup, planning together etc).<br/><br/>The core ideas of Sturdy are:<br/>1. High-level operations around developer intent<br/>2. Early feedback (like pair-programming) which is also given asynchronously (like pull request reviews)<br/>3. Compatible with existing tooling<br/>On the website - <a href="https://getsturdy.com/">https://getsturdy.com/</a> there are some short clips of how it works.  It's pretty easy to try out, I would love to hear what you folks think.<br/><br/>Sturdy is itself open source - <a href="https://github.com/sturdy-dev/sturdy">https://github.com/sturdy-dev/sturdy</a> (stars welcome :slightly_smiling_face: ).<br/>Cheers!

The clickbait tl;dr: “Why the Elm Architecture is Doomed: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Mutable State.” Tongue out-of-cheek, I’ll be talking about what I think we can (re)learn from the hardware world, especially around modeling, simulation, feedback control, and dynamical systems.

For those following along on the development of Clerk, we're preparing to ship a feature where you can livecode HTML controls in the notebook view that have two-way binding to Clojure state atoms on the JVM side. This allows for moldable user interface development in the context of one's usual editor environment. There are a couple of examples in the images attached to this tweet: :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1492110714588250118?s=20&amp;t=kHaW82d1qYPo8pEEEJzQJw">https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1492110714588250118?s=20&amp;t=kHaW82d1qYPo8pEEEJzQJw</a>

More adventures in sandboxing[1][2]<br/><br/>I've been working on a Zettelkasten app: <a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-teliva-2022-02-10">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-teliva-2022-02-10</a> (video; 4 minutes)<br/><br/>One interesting insight here was that putting raw file operations directly in <tt>main</tt> makes the app easy to audit.

Hey folks :wave: ,<br/>I’m kicking off a new <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love</a> chapter focused on Computer Science Education in particular. If you haven’t encountered Papers We Love, it’s kinda a book club for academic CS papers. <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/edu">This chapter</a> will be focused on papers about learning and teaching computer science.<br/><br/>Sharing here since I know there’s a lot of interest in the process of learning programming and how our language design and choices influence it. If you have a paper about CS education that you love, or would like to present, we’d love to hear your suggestions! You can submit them via our <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/edu/discussions/1">GitHub Discussions board</a>. Would love to welcome y’all to present!<br/><br/>We are still ramping up, but are targeting the last Thursday of each month for live presentations, with paper discussions continuing async via the discussion board in between.

Hey Folks,<br/><br/>Nicolae, one of the cofounders of Clay (<a href="http://clay.com">clay.com</a>) here (along with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Kareem Amin</span>). I’ve been a long time Future of Coding member (and largely lurker though I used to head to the in-person events and know some of y’all :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>We just launched Clay on Product Hunt (<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/clay-8">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/clay-8</a>) &amp; have also opened up the product to a wider audience. Appreciate any support y’all can give us!<br/><br/>The FoC community and exploring ideas in this space is very near and dear to our hearts, and at some point we’ll need to publish some more in-depth posts of all the directions we’ve explored and how the product’s evolved. We started as a more developer focused product (similar to tools like Parse &amp; Supabase), but have over time skewed more to end-users and internal tools and automations. Today, the product is a spreadsheet-like database that has a few interesting features.<br/><br/><b>Tables that are aware of their data-type, and can automatically fill in missing information - e.g. People &amp; Company Tables</b><br/>• We observed that one of the main use cases of Spreadsheets is people building lists of things. In the case of search engines, similarly people tend to search for known “types” of content. <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> and their lists of Schemas: <a href="https://schema.org/docs/full.html">https://schema.org/docs/full.html</a> is a pretty good list of the types of entities people end up actually looking for. We’ve explored what it could be like if you gave users tables that were more opinionated entity tables that could tap into public data sets, and improve over time to autocomplete - specifically for Co’s &amp; People which happen to be common use cases for growth &amp; recruiting. These entities exist in lots of different tools companies use, and also lots of different enrichment APIs, and so by mapping these structured entities we can make it easier to have one-click integrations where things are pre-mapped and can just be turned on.<br/><b>Integrations that you can use as “magic-columns” in your tables (think Zapier &amp; Airtable combined)</b><br/>• One of the areas we’ve gone deeper is giving people an easy way to set up integrations as columns in their table - e.g. you have a list of companies and want to see which of them are already in your CRM - that should be as easy as just adding a CRM column to your table and then being able to easily create them in the corresponding tools. The known entity types should make this easy, as well as creating and enriching those entities back into your tools and databases.<br/><b>Pull in data from anywhere into tables in a few clicks using sources</b><br/>• Sources let you quickly pull in lists of data from your tools or places like Github, Twitter, etc. - so that you have some interesting data to get going in a few clicks. You could for example easily build an entire table of every website matching some Google Query, and then go and scrape those sites to check if they mention specific keywords - all with a few simple sources &amp; integrations! <br/><b>Mapping, Scraping &amp; working with structured data from the web - a shared repository of website data mappings</b><br/>• One of the ideas that we’re excited about is that Clay makes it really easy to map structured data on any webpage via our Chrome Extension - for example, going to a Zapier App description page and opening up the Chrome Extension shows a structured understanding of the data on the page. Ee let people describe how to find the page based on the URL structure and the shape of the page), and then define selectors to pull data from the page in a point and click way (you can also define them yourself if you know how selectors work). The idea is that once a type of page is mapped, everyone should then be able to use that definition rather than having to redefine it themselves. This way you can quickly re-create the database of most sites and then continue to add additional data - e.g. I did some quick data analysis on what types of apps does Zapier focus on and how highly are they rated on G2, Capterra and other sites, all in a few clicks).<br/>• We think this approach has broader applications, but it’s already been pretty cool to see it work in action, and we’re looking forward to making it as easy as pasting a link to get the structured data you want from a site.<br/>Happy to answer any questions y’all have! We’re also hiring so please get in touch if you’re interested!<br/><br/>Here’s a video that shows a lot of the core concepts<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V44XjAXvLlY&amp;t=55s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V44XjAXvLlY&amp;t=55s</a>

I just saw a post about <a href="https://github.com/samuelmtimbo/unit">unit </a>which is a really beautiful tool, and wanted to share my own work in functional graphical programming. The video below is the prototype demo from 2016 when I was starting my VR programming company <a href="https://primitive.io">https://primitive.io</a><br/><br/>In this original version of our VR code visualization tool, the focus was on functional graphical building blocks of a simple RSA encryption algorithm written in Lisp. You can see function stacks in the animated runtime. The version that then became Primitive changed to focus on visualizing file system structure and class/method parsing. I would love to get back to function body parsing at some point again. Please let me know your thoughts:

Hi FoC,<br/><br/>We just released version Alpha 1.8.0 of CRANQ (<a href="http://cranq.io">cranq.io</a>)!<br/><br/>For those that don't know, CRANQ is - despite what the website says - a general-purpose "low-coding" IDE and code repository. It compiles to JavaScript (npm packages), and is fully extensible from within. This release is still far from our original vision - lacking in instrumentation, types, search, and general UX - but is usable enough to prototype APIs and integrations.<br/><br/>Quick download links:<br/>• Linux (deb): <a href="https://release.cranq.io/cranq_1.8.0_amd64.deb">https://release.cranq.io/cranq_1.8.0_amd64.deb</a><br/>• Linux (rpm): <a href="https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0-1.x86_64.rpm">https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0-1.x86_64.rpm</a><br/>• MacOs: <a href="https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0-x64.dmg">https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0-x64.dmg</a><br/>• Windows: <a href="https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0_Setup.exe">https://release.cranq.io/Cranq-1.8.0_Setup.exe</a><br/>Thoughts, feedback welcome.<br/>We're also looking for case studies - projects that we help you build in CRANQ. DM me if you'd like to participate in our alpha programme.

Hello everyone!<br/><br/>After a year of work, I am finally presenting the result of my Master's thesis!:tada::mortar_board:<br/>I developed and studied a live programming environment that can provide meaningful information about the runtime behaviour of a program in practically every edit state, while retaining the intuitive and flexible interface of text editors.<br/><br/>To provide meaningful runtime behaviour information in edit states containing incomplete programs with syntax, type or logic errors, the programming environment has to isolate errors and continue functioning for unaffected parts of the program.<br/>I call this error tolerance.<br/><br/>Tolerance of syntax errors is realized with an integrated structure editor that incorporates a notion of incompleteness I call construction sites.<br/>Essentially, these are abstract syntax tree nodes that can contain arbitrary characters and other AST nodes.<br/><br/>Evaluation of the program continues "around errors" instead of aborting with an exception or resulting in some "undefined" value.<br/>Because the results this produces are much more informative than an exception or undefined value, they can help the programmer find the sources of issues and resolve them much better.<br/><br/>Because the programming environment is often evaluating unfinished code, evaluation diverges much more often.<br/>The programming environment handles this smoothly by only evaluating parts of the runtime information that are displayed and providing a mode of evaluation where the number of reductions is limited by a configurable number.<br/>This enables partial results in cases of non-termination.<br/><br/>You can try out the editor for yourself at <a href="https://cdfa.github.io/frugel/">https://cdfa.github.io/frugel/</a> :eyes: or by downloading a much better performing native executable <a href="https://github.com/cdfa/frugel/releases">from GitHub</a>.<br/>I also created a demo video :tv: (<a href="https://archive.org/details/demo_20220123">WebArchive version</a> (still uploading), <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4UM7midD373UdpzWUFxzdKcraitEpDk/view?usp=sharing">Google Drive version</a>) and attached a draft version of the thesis.<br/>I hope to follow up this week with a version that fixes some bugs.<br/>This Wednesday, I will be giving an online presentation about it.<br/>If you are interested in attending, I can PM you a link to watch it.<br/><br/>Please let me know what you think!

On my journey learning about CRDTs and building local-first software, I just published a <b>new open source library; <a href="https://github.com/YousefED/Matrix-CRDT">Matrix-CRDT</a>.</b><br/><br/>Matrix-CRDT connects <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a> with <a href="http://Matrix.org">Matrix.org</a>. Basically, you can connect your client-side data store to Matrix, and instead of chat messages, it sends an event stream of data model updates (CRDT updates) to Matrix.<br/><br/>It’s now on the frontpage of HN, so get it while it’s hot :wink: Feedback welcome!

Future of Coding • Episode 54<br/>Ella Hoeppner • Vlojure<br/><br/>I was immediately interested in <a href="https://vlojure.io">Vlojure</a> because of the visual style on display — source code represented as nested circles; an earthy brown instead of the usual dark/light theme. But as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OcAUhe3E1E">introduction video</a> progressed, Ella showed off a scattering of little ideas that each seemed strikingly clever and obvious in hindsight. You'd drag one of the circle "forms" to the bottom right to evaluate it, or to the bottom left to delete it. The sides of the screen are flanked by "formbars" that hold, well, whatever you want. You can reconfigure these formbars to your exact liking. Everything is manipulated with drag. The interface exudes a sense that it was designed with wholly different goals and tastes than what we usually see in visual programming projects — perfect subject matter for our show.<br/><br/>• <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/054">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/054</a>

Hi all! New here, I wanted to share something I made over the weekend that I thought some people here might find interesting/have thoughts on. It's a self-hosting web code editor that stores and edits "files" in the browser's IndexedDB and uses a service worker to serve them as if there was an actual backend. You can try it out here (only works in Chromium-based browsers because it uses ES modules in the worker): <a href="https://reflection-editor.netlify.app/">https://reflection-editor.netlify.app/</a> Source code is also available at <a href="https://github.com/Merlin04/reflection">https://github.com/Merlin04/reflection</a>.

Any devs interested in tinkering on a tool to export social graph/network data from walled gardens like LinkedIn/Facebook/Discord, and build some lo-fi chat/comms on top?<br/><br/>I've been hacking on this starting with LinkedIn.  If you enable authentication with LinkedIn's 3-legged flow (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?tabs=HTTPS">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?tabs=HTTPS</a>), then you can use the Connections API with Field Request to return the connection names and unique IDs/urns (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/connections-api">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/connections-api</a>) for all of your connections.  With that, you have a first-connections social graph.  And then, just need a way to send message blobs to those folks!<br/><br/>Here's a repo where I've been working on it:<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/sbutler-gh/earthkind">https://github.com/sbutler-gh/earthkind</a><br/><br/>^ At the moment, it's stuck because the LinkedIn 3-legged auth isn't working — not sure exactly what the problem is, whether CORS or with the redirect URIs.  I added documentation in the <tt>index.svelte</tt> file to describe more there.<br/><br/>If it is CORS errors, I'm not sure if that's bypassable locally, so I also spun up a deployed instance at <a href="https://earthkind.pages.dev/">https://earthkind.pages.dev/</a>.  That gives some redirect errors when trying to authenticate which might provide more information.<br/><br/>I've been reflecting on this for awhile, think it could be really useful!  For example, do you ever have an in-depth DM chat with a friend where you wish other people could check out the discussion/thoughts coming out?  By building something that's described here, we could even give people an option to have chats that are publically indexable and discoverable — the equivalent of chatting in public, so others can overhear and join the conversation.  Just one of the possibilities!

Hi all! I’ve been diving into CRDT tech lately to build local-first collaborative apps. So far I had a great experience with Yjs - but I found the API a bit cumbersome.<br/>I’ve been working a new open source library to make it <em>really easy</em> to work with state that’s shared across multiple users and that syncs automatically. It supports React, Vue, Svelte, or plain javascript.<br/><br/>By using Javascript Proxies, the API looks just like a regular app, e.g.: <tt>store.todos.push( { completed: true, title: "write code" } );</tt> - and the Reactive Programming model makes it effortless to listen to changes.<br/><br/>Anway, I just put it live on <a href="https://syncedstore.org/">https://syncedstore.org/</a> - would really welcome your feedback!<br/><br/>PS: it’s also on HN (see “show” page), comments / votes there are always appreciated to help a fellow FoCer ;)

Hey folks! I've been working on a language for quickly sketching out app ideas/user flows, inspired by the concept of a "software breadboard" from Basecamp's Shape Up methodology (<a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding">https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding</a>): it's definitely not ready for prime time yet, but I think it's got the bones of a decently expressive rapid prototyping language. Feel free to play around with the demo at <a href="https://breadboard.redefine.software">https://breadboard.redefine.software</a>. Source code is on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/redefinesoftware/breadboarder">http://github.com/redefinesoftware/breadboarder</a>. Curious to hear your feedback!

Hi, I have built a serverless runtime for <a href="http://observablehq.com">observablehq.com</a> called <a href="https://webcode.run">https://webcode.run</a>. This extends Observable's reactive notebooks to the backend. Its unique features are instant deploys, and it can redirect traffic to your browser, so you can do devtool or console.log debugging against production traffic. It's a unique way of sharing code across frontend and backend.<br/><br/>My aim is to create a serverless environment that is a pleasure to use as a developer. I am really desperate for feedback, so if you give it a go let know the positives and negatives.

Future of Coding • Episode 53<br/>Scott Anderson • End-user Programming in VR<br/><br/><span style="background-color:#ccf">@Scott Anderson</span> has spent the better part of a decade working on end-user programming features for VR and the metaverse. He’s worked on playful creation tools in the indie game Luna, scripting for Oculus Home and Horizon Worlds at Facebook, and a bunch of concepts for novel programming interfaces in virtual reality. Talking to Scott felt a little bit like peeking into what’s coming around the bend for programming. For now, most of us do our programming work on a little 2D rectangle, with a clear split between the world around the computer and the one inside it. That might change — we may find ourselves inside a virtual environment where the code we write and the effects of running it happen in the space around us. We may find ourselves in that space with other people, also doing their own programming. This space might be designed, operated, and owned by a single megacorp with a specific profit motive. Scott takes us through these possibilities — how things are actually shaping up right now and how he feels about where they’re going, having spent so much time exploring this space.<br/><br/>• <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/053">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/053</a>

I can never remember jq's syntax so I wrote a json processor that parses json input onto a stack, and transforms the JSON by chaining simple stack operations together. It feels a lot more natural to me, but maybe I'm too close to the code :slightly_smiling_face:  <a href="https://github.com/dnmfarrell/jp">https://github.com/dnmfarrell/jp</a>

We open sourced our Clojure computational notebook library, <a href="https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk">Clerk</a>, today. Here's an example of combining Clerk with my WikiData wrapper, <a href="https://github.com/jackrusher/mundaneum">Mundaneum</a>, to interactively ask for some physicists and what they invented/discovered. Not bad.

Hi All! I’ve created a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for people to express “product definitions” of consumer products (apps+web apps), which can then be “compiled” into full running software, and a platform that actually generates the app builds, generates and hosts the backend and web apps etc.<br/><br/>My belief is that it is too hard to build consumer software today. This difficulty is in large part because we build at too low a level of abstraction. I believe we should raise the level of abstraction to the conceptual level for defining most features, and only write custom code for things that can’t be expressed at this high level. With that approach, we can compile the high-level abstraction to native UI for all platforms and make developing polished x-platform software ~1000X+ easier.<br/><br/>Would love any thoughts / feedback, and would love to find people interested in this space to collaborate with (and just raised some money to enable that)!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-abstraction-for-programming-by-multiple-orders-of-magnitude-06f2566973714b3298d8f3cf0ad29c66">https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Sutro-raising-the-level-of-abstraction-for-programming-by-multiple-orders-of-magnitude-06f2566973714b3298d8f3cf0ad29c66</a>

Recently built a tool that enables climate and community action orgs to sync their public calendars, so people on the ground can get a view of all of the organizing activities happening near them and where to plug-in:<br/><br/><a href="https://rebrand.ly/just-start">https://rebrand.ly/just-start</a><br/><br/>If this sounds useful, feel free to try it out and share!  Anybody can post events and calendars directly from the main page, no login or account required.  (Most of the calendars/data are US-based right now, so if you're somewhere else, just try searching a large US city.)<br/><br/>It's also open source (<a href="https://github.com/sbutler-gh/just-start">https://github.com/sbutler-gh/just-start</a>) — collaboration from all backgrounds welcome!  There are some big questions to come around permissions, data rights and sovereignty, respectful ways to work with calendar data, and general features/capabilities/vision, and it would be great to have perspective from a number of communities/fields on that.<br/><br/>The vision is that this could serve other organizing use cases as well, like coordinating with attendees after an initial meeting, a place for discussions and sharing artifacts (alternative to FB groups), designing leaflets and posters, mapping local organizations and resources, knowledge sharing across networks, opportunities for engagement and civic action, viewing helpful local data, accessing funding for organizing and local initiatives, and more ... If you have any questions, ideas, feedback, wishes, or other thoughts, would love to hear your perspective and collaborate!  (In case I don't see a response here, here's a <a href="https://discord.gg/dTSmGuBXt8">Discord channel for the project</a>)

Hi everyone, we recently updated our website with some new ideas for how we are aiming to explain our programming environment at <a href="http://story.ai">story.ai</a><br/>We’ve definitely been mostly focused on implementation and technical challenges mostly, but it’s really nice to have something more substantial on our website to talk about our work. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>And here’s a little teaser from a pitch deck we’re currently working on, too!

Lisperanto - in browser structured editor and version control (in a future) <a href="https://uprun.github.io/lisperanto/">https://uprun.github.io/lisperanto/</a><br/>hi, this project is still under development, currently it have basic algebraic primitives and possibility to create own functions, it is local-first and statically-hosted,<br/>in a future all operations on AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) will be stored in order to have proper version control and to allow cooperation on a code.<br/>Though I have selected Lisp idea about code as a data, this does not mean it should be always Lisp syntax, I will try to borrow nice features from other languages as well hence the name.

<b>Annotated Lambda Diagrams:</b><br/><br/>I have an idea for a semi-graphical programming interface that<br/>as far as I can tell is very different from anything that is currently in existence.<br/>I call it:  »Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)«<br/><br/>The core of the idea is to annotate John Trumps "Lambda Diagrams"<br/>( see here: <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html">https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html</a> )<br/>in order to make them into a practically useful and enjoyable programming user interface. (Hopefully even live coding capable).<br/><br/>Don't be tricked into grouping this together with node editors.<br/>While there are visual line and box elements, this is definitely not a node editor.<br/>That is because there simply are no nodes here.<br/><br/>What may look like nodes are merely redundant tags/annotations of the lines.<br/>As such there is no need to decide<br/>— which one of wires and nodes represents values and<br/>— which one represents value-transforming-functions<br/>So these ALDs are also not to confuse with what could be called "inverse node editors" where the roles of lines and nodes are swapped from the usual association. Also note that having functions being first class values does not remove this issue of node editors … as far as I can see.<br/><br/><b>Here is a writeup of the basic idea:</b><br/>• :fire: <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a><br/><b>Here is a page with further Mockups:</b><br/>• :fire: <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram_mockups">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram_mockups</a> <br/>Drawing these mockups by hand (in inkscape) is a lot of effort.<br/>But implementing this even more so.<br/>I did not get very far in my first attempt. To put it mildly.<br/>I didn't even get to implementing the actual diagrams …<br/>Zooming programming interface experiment:<br/>• Take1/2: <a href="https://youtu.be/VcoBaUDSHFM">https://youtu.be/VcoBaUDSHFM</a><br/>• Take2/2: <a href="https://youtu.be/YWUBRyDAVG4">https://youtu.be/YWUBRyDAVG4</a>

I'll try to make machine videos more regularly from now on.

Hello FoC Community,<br/><br/>I am part of a team -- including <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Daniel Krasner</span> -- that has long been thinking about issues of personal computing, malleability, programming, and authorship. Last year we had funding for a lab and worked on a <a href="https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk)">web-based authoring system we call Simpletalk</a> (you can see <a href="https://simpletalk.systems/">a live version of it here</a>). I recently gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U6MkU5fLJw">a talk at Strange Loop</a> about the wider vision and motivations for this work, as well as a short demo of the system. You can read more detail about our motivation in <a href="https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk/blob/master/ComputingManifesto.pdf">this document</a>.<br/><br/>We would like to propose two things to the community here. The first would be a live talk / demo session, and we would like to gauge your interest in attending. Second, we will soon have test accounts for people to make their own Simpletalk stacks and worlds. If you are interested in participating, feel free to DM either of us and we will let you know when it is ready.<br/><br/>Any feedback and/or discussion is always welcome.<br/><br/>PS - Simpletalk is not a "product" and is still experimental. Use the latest versions of Firefox for the best experience.<br/><br/>Thanks!

I saw this illustration of a node-wire visual programming language in an App Store "featured app" story. The app looked pretty bad, but this totally unrelated illustration is quietly brilliant. I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided to "review" this fake-ass programming system. It's full of stuff that (A) is totally fake, (B) would totally work, and (C) is better than any other node-wire programming tool I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Here's my review: <a href="https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md">https://github.com/ivanreese/visual-programming-codex/blob/main/impressions/app-store-illustration.md</a>

It is at the same time attempt to introduce <tt>ubiquitous language</tt> (in domain-driven-design (DDD) context) for daily communication in marketing+development teams cooperation.<br/><br/>In an attempt to de-mystify some common myths of what <tt>growth hackers(marketing communication specialists)</tt> actually do and how <tt>developers/admins/devopsers/u-name-it</tt> could help them do their work better (or at least stop creating huge roadblocks, such as instroducing react&amp;friends in acquisition funnel websites, to give an example) - *I would like to propose to an online webinar for FoC community those above mentioned <tt>how to tell a story via web medium</tt> trainings* (free of charge) .<br/><br/>Please put :heavy_plus_sign: if you’d be interested in joining this webinar. In case at least 4-5 people would express interest, we could start arrange’ing date&amp;time in a thread, including any special topics you’d like to be addressed and included for me to prepare on top of current content.

Hi Every one,<br/>I am working on an interactive programming language named Flourish,  which aims to be programmable only in run time. The only available programming style being exploratory programming, I believe it implicitly forces TDD.  Even the concept of dependency injection is somewhat inclusive of language design.<br/><a href="https://github.com/FlourishLang/flourish1.5">https://github.com/FlourishLang/flourish1.5</a><br/>Please give your thoughts.

I'd like to make a general point: Arbitrary mathematical statements formulated symbolically can be formulated with concrete dynamic variables instead (by which I mean concrete values you can change and whose instances are all kept in sync). Here is an example of this with the pythagorean theorem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QemB5t94slc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QemB5t94slc</a> Normally it would read "If a,b, and c are the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse respectively of a right triangle then a^2+b^2=c^2". However, this is equivalent to an expression with dynamic variables, as illustrated in the video. Any instance of the general theorem can be achieved by altering the values of the dynamic variables to that particular instance. Moreover, no matter how the values of the formulation with dynamic variables is altered the resulting statement will always be an instance of the pythagorean theorem because the values at different locations are always kept in sync. Thus, insofar as the two formulations have the same instances, the two are equivalent. (also, modulo the fact that the present scrubbing mechanism can only produce integers).<br/><br/>This is part of a broader set of ideas I'm exploring. I'm trying to develop a theory of what I'm terming "formal dynamic mathematics." By dynamic mathematics I mean mathematics employing dynamic variables, and which aren't necessarily "mathematical objects" (any sort of set) but could be interactive visual elements such as a line segment which you can move around and whose length you can alter or metamathematical objects such as variable names. These sorts of variables abound in geogebra, bret victors work, apparatus (Toby Schachman), and pane (Joshua Horowitz), among other 'live' systems. I think we would benefit from a more systematic understanding of the interface primitives that go into them.<br/><br/>We can roughly analyze these applications in terms of three primitives: transclusion, evaluation, and varriers. By transclusion I mean the live copying of the contents of one part of a page into another part of the page. Having a transclusion from one region to another and another back again ensures that those two regions will always have the same value, effectively yielding a variable without a name or a value. Evaluation is a relation between different regions of a page where the values in different regions of the page are operated on and displayed in another location.  Finally, varriers are primitives having values and modes of interaction. A scrubbable number is an example of a varrier. (apologies for the neologism; suggestions for better words or similar vocabulary is welcome)<br/><br/>Just as normal formal mathematics is built out of its own primitives (sequences of symbols and rules of inference) formal dynamic mathematics is built out of the above primitives. Inferences rules can be formalized as evaluation schemas so constructions in these systems are proofs.<br/><br/>Although this kind of math could be used to design end user programming systems, I'm mostly interested in its application to math itself, as an extension of the language of math at a fundamental level. An idea I've been exploring this year substantially has been how to develop an entirely visual language (save for the logical connectives of propositional and predicate calculus) for vector algebra, without any symbols, and in particular to be able to state and prove the pythagorean theorem from axioms. (This problem was pretty much posed by Hamish Todd about a year ago).  Dynamic variables and varriers (for visual vectors) easily let you do away with symbolic variables. This reduces the problem to devising a visualization for concrete static terms built with functions. We can easily visualize terms like (1,2)+(3,5), and proj_{(1,1)}(4,5) but visualizations for more complex terms generally seem ad hoc. I think there is a solution here, but it's a matter of understanding why there isn't an ideal solution, and I don't understand that well enough at this point to share.

Hi! I have created a snapshot version 0.6.0 for Operon which is the basis for the first "official" release. Find it from <a href="https://operon.io">https://operon.io</a>.<br/><br/>"Operon is a programming language which can be easily embedded with JVM-based languages (Java, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, etc.) or run standalone with the native-version. Operon is especially great for transforming and handling JSON-data. At first sight it appears to be a kind of query-language, but it is actually a functional programming language that has clear syntax and semantics and can be used for many purposes (e.g. microservices, integrations) and even to build larger solutions."<br/><br/>Operon is licensed under Operon-license.<br/><br/>Please give it a test-drive and let me hear back from you :blush:

Hi all,  this is my first post here.  Ever since I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A">this literate programming talk </a>I have been messing with existing literate programming tools. After trying multiple tools, I ended up writing my own tool using python + sphinx + cog + markdown. I am calling it wheel.<br/><br/>Because of cog - I believe literate programming can enable many interesting things like arbitrary preprocessing and code generation instead of just mangle and tangle. In plannr I have experimented with adding some syntax to hylang, a dialect of lisp. I think literate programming is criss-cross programming :slightly_smiling_face: and enables <em>feature driven development</em>. I have documented my findings here <a href="https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel/why.html">https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel/why.html</a><br/><br/>Would love to hear you guys think!<br/><br/><b>Links</b><br/><br/>1. <a href="https://xyzzyapps.link/wheel">Wheel</a> - a literate programming tool with python + sphinx + cog + markdown.<br/>2.

[Dida](<a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida">https://github.com/jamii/dida</a>) updates:<br/><li> Added a js&lt;-&gt;wasm api (example [here](<a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/core.html">https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/core.html</a>), sugar upcoming so it looks more like [this](<a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/sugar.zig))">https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/2caffd4461037fe5c06b2457251a94e74cfda1dc/examples/sugar.zig))</a>. From the js side the wasm api looks exactly the same as the node api, so you can share code between them.<br/><li> Indexes are now LSM trees instead of, uh, unsorted arrays. Joins are no longer silly.<br/><li> Distinct got a faster implementation.<br/><li> Added a reduce operator.<br/><li> Fixed a bug in pointstamp order by adding a new constraint to graph layout.<br/><li> Lots more unit tests.<br/><br/>Still not quite worth using, but might get there in the next month or two.

Haven't posted here in a while, but still lurking from time to time :smile:<br/><br/>We've added a "portal" system to our node/wire based programming software GraphN, which instantly removed 90% of all readability issues you often have when wires cross over, creating a spaghetti-like view of your graph.<br/><br/>Internally, this is basically just a variable, but funnily enough, our CTO had implemented the system, but I didn't "get" how it could benefit artists until I started thinking of it as "portals" :smiling_face_with_tear: was really surprised that such an easy concept doesn't exist in most art-focused node graphs.<br/><br/>The interface you see me tweaking at the top-right corner is basically a set of "exposed" parameter of that graph, which makes it easy to create powerful tools for artists, without asking them to touch visual coding at all. If they ever get curious, they can always dive in and change stuff, of course.

Looking for a research assistant. DM me a resume and/or portfolio if you’re interested. May be especially interesting for people interested in tools for thought and Web3. Here are some of the core questions we're pursuing: <br/><br/>What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate collaborative knowledge synthesis? What sorts of implicit metadata could you capture from people's behaviors? How do you create powerful interfaces for structuring thought into a knowledge graph? What user behaviors are people doing already that specifies structure that is not being instantiated into a structure? <a href="https://twitter.com/roberthaisfield/status/1405557321074233344?s=21">https://twitter.com/roberthaisfield/status/1405557321074233344?s=21</a>

Now that we have auto-update in our live preview, I’m starting to make some gifs that show off how cool GuidedTrack is.<br/><br/>What if you could just copy / paste a list of questions from a doc into a text editor, lightly format it, and get a form?<br/><br/>It’s amazing how handy the normal keyboard shortcuts for text editors are, like copy, paste, undo, etc.

Hi,<br/><br/>I’ve decided to step out of my comfort zone and share with you a codesandbox which has the flowrunner-canvas editor embedded. This is the side project I have been working on the last couple of years and shown some video’s of it here. And to manage expectations: this is a small part of what is possible already, and only a very small amount of node-types have been made available when using the editor this way. Also expect some bugs ;-) The editor is responsive but support for touch screens can and will be improved in the future.<br/>But hopefully it gives enough impressions on some of the core ideas of the project.<br/><br/>The flow that is loaded when opening the codesandbox, has a form-node with radio-buttons, when you choose the top most radiobutton, two input fields will appear. The values you enter in those input fields are multiplied together by the expression-node and the output is shown in the debug-node. <br/><br/>All nodes manipulate the payload (a basic javascript object), which is passed through to the next output. The results are visible in realtime as well as the execution path the flow follows.<br/><br/>In this example, localstorage is used for storing the flow (it is initialised with an example automatically). But this doesn’t work in incognito mode, please be aware of that if you want to try it out like that.<br/><br/><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wljy9">https://codesandbox.io/s/flowrunner-canvas-wljy9</a><br/><br/>Feedback is very welcome! :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks!

One of two talks from this year's ClojureD (German Clojure conference) about work with which I've been helping the team at <a href="https://nextjournal.com/">Nextjournal</a>. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0TafHXszgM">talk focuses on a UI/UX redesign</a> that updates context-driven, keyboard-friendly ideas from older environments (especially Lisp Machines!) with modern niceties. One thing we don't talk about here is that in the future the command subsystem will also be expandable and scriptable by end users. There's more Lisp Machine-related goodness coming in the next talk video, which should be released in the coming days. :slightly_smiling_face:

Another video that's too long for #two-minute-week: giving the Lisp-based Mu shell just <em>a little smidge</em> of syntax.<br/><br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-06-23">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-2021-06-23</a> (8 minutes)<br/><br/>With this I think I'm done with the high-level language or indeed any language design. 3 notations is all this computer will come with:<br/>• verbose, fast, unsafe<br/>• verbose, fast, safe<br/>• terse, slow, safe<br/>(Others are welcome to add more, of course. Part of the goal is to leave some "complexity headroom" for that sort of fun activity.)<br/><br/>What's next: anything but new notations (in this fork)<br/>• Low-level capabilities. Mouse, timer (Mu still has no clock!), maybe a network driver or six<br/>• Interesting programs. I might try to build an offline reader for <a href="http://internet-in-a-box.org">http://internet-in-a-box.org</a>. Or maybe for FoC archives?!<br/>• Flesh out the prototyping environment a bit more based on experiences actually using it in anger.<br/>Main project page: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a>

I'm working on a library for incremental computation that can handle loops/fixpoints/recursion, supports out-of-order inputs, will soon support automatic parallelization and whose api is focused on being a good backend for a language.<br/><br/>There's still a fair bit of work to go before it's useful, but there's enough working already to be worth reading - <a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida">https://github.com/jamii/dida</a>

a small (silent) demo of my project. it aims to be a productive editor for any typed property graphs, it do this by expanding the graph as a spanning tree, so it appears like an outliner. I am currently using it to keep my notes and references, but the idea is it should be extended to cover other needs. The key is it aims to be an editor of the ultimate data structure: property graph. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Hdl19iCVbNmrrfVr6zNXECvM6VPrBPW/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Hdl19iCVbNmrrfVr6zNXECvM6VPrBPW/view</a>

<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/050">Episode 50</a> (:birthday:) of the Future of Coding podcast is out now.<br/><br/>Today, the guest is <a href="https://maryrosecook.com">Mary Rose Cook</a>, among whose thousand-and-one side projects you'll find <a href="http://islalanguage.org">Isla</a> and <a href="http://codelauren.com">Code Lauren</a>. Both are experimental programming environments with their own bespoke languages, focussed on learnability and visualization. In the case of Code Lauren, we also see another theme of Mary's work — taking the largely invisible processing done by compilers / interpreters and making it visible and interactive. Mary also made a totally awful game that I hate so much, but to find out what that is you'll just have to listen to the show (or read the largely unedited transcript — again, sorry Jack).

Hey folks, after a long year of building and rebuilding <a href="https://gadget.dev/">Gadget</a>, we're finally gearing up for a launch. We're looking for early alpha users if anyone is interested (<a href="https://gadget.dev/">drop your email on the site</a> or DM me).<br/><br/><b>Problem:</b> Web development is slower and more expensive than it should be, because of the endless, repetitive boilerplate/glue code that developers have to manouver.<br/><b>Challenge:</b> Build a platform that gives developers a set of higher level building blocks, while providing them with the ability to drop down to a lower level when the abstractions don't work.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Gadget, a preconfigured, bundled development platform (IDE +++) that gives you a set of components with sane defaults that you can override, in code,  designed to meet the needs of modern web application developers.<br/><br/>Basically, Gadget is our vision of what "low code for devs" should actually feel like (for web app development). An experience where the computer is responsible for all the annoying busywork the developer doesn't want to do,  while leaving the engineer to make all the engineering decisions.<br/><br/>Here's a not-so-short video (20 min) where I build, deploy and test a declarative API for the backend of a Kanban board:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56">https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56</a><br/><br/>Want to try it out?

You'll need to <tt>translate_emulated</tt> rather than just <tt>translate</tt>, which is much slower. You'll also need to remove <tt>-enable-kvm</tt> and potentially replace it with some other type of Qemu acceleration.

A program to render the silhouette of the Mandelbrot set. Type-safe. Every statement translates to a single instruction of machine code.<br/><br/>Floating point: <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/mandelbrot.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/mandelbrot.mu.html</a><br/>Fixed point: <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/mandelbrot-fixed.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/mandelbrot-fixed.mu.html</a><br/><br/>It's not portable (x86 only) and less expressive than C. On the other hand, there's no danger of undefined behavior, and I don't have to fight C to check for overflow. And the whole supply chain to run it is kilobytes rather than megabytes large.<br/><br/>Main project page: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a>

:satellite_antenna: I have a new project to share with you: <b><a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/">Hest — The Podcast</a></b><br/><br/>What's Hest? It's my own personal FoC project, and I'll be using this new podcast to explore the design of it in great depth. The podcast is inspired by early episodes of the Future of Coding podcast, in which Steve recapped his research with a style that felt to me a little like <em>daydreaming</em>. I enjoyed those episodes very much, and have wanted to do something similar ever since I took over Steve's show. I've come up with my own twist on the format that should make it even more enjoyable and useful. Episodes will be brief, frequent, and light. There are already 6 episodes in the feed, so that you can try it out for a bit to see if you enjoy it before deciding to subscribe on an ongoing basis. The primary audience is... myself — this is an audio sketchbook. But I think some of you will find it interesting too.<br/><br/>For a slightly longer writeup about the podcast: <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/">https://ivanish.ca/hest-podcast/</a><br/><br/>To subscribe,<br/>• use this hand-crafted RSS feed: <a href="https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss">https://ivanish.ca/hest.rss</a><br/>• search for <b>Hest</b> or <b>Ivan Reese</b> in your podcast player of choice,<br/>• or click one of the buttons here: <a href="https://pod.link/1559446316">https://pod.link/1559446316</a><br/>This might not appeal to many people, but for those to whom it does, I sincerely hope you enjoy it.

I’m currently studying and designing tools for web scraping/automation.

We’ll compensate you with an Amazon gift card of $25 USD (or equivalent currency). Prior experience with web scraping or test automation (e.g., Selenium, Puppeteer, Cypress) is welcome but not necessary!

Hey friends, it's been sometime since I posted an update on Gadget. For those unfamiliar with Gadget, we're trying to build a development platform that steps in and handles the bs boilerplate/repetitive stuff for you, but then steps out of your way and lets you code when you prefer. The platform is nearing completion and launch, if anyone is interested in playing with the alpha, ping me.<br/><br/>This demo is. a bit longer (20 min) but in that time, I build and productionize a full set of APIs to power a kanban board (with auth, access control and the works) and run some graphQL mutations to show that its all real.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56">https://www.loom.com/share/732816bb327c4155b61199d2d1733c56</a><br/><br/>Feedback welcome!

I’ve been thinking about how to prototype non-textual programming environments. I’m not talking about block or node based environments. I think text has still a lot of benefits for representing code. What I want to break free from is the typewriter paradigm where you can only put one character after the other line after line. I want a blank canvas where I can combine text with graphical representations (Statecharts, Graphs, Tables ...). As an example here is my latest prototype that mixes text with graphics to make it easier to understand data transformations. It doesn’t fully realize this freeform idea (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_5KxKmvhlA">video</a> or see attached image)<br/><br/>My current workflow has been to prototype ideas like this by starting with a minimal version of the editor and then incrementally add features which allow building more complex examples to eventually reach the point where you can build real applications with it. That’s the theory, but so far with all my prototypes (including this one) I eventually reach a point where I’m no longer convinced that it’s worth it to invest more time because it is still such a long way to go until I can build something real with it.<br/><br/>I’m now thinking that maybe I’m approaching this whole problem from the wrong side. I think the biggest risk for finding non textual representations for code is whether they work at the scale of real applications or if they break down beyond simple toy examples. While building the editor I’m learning very little about how well the representation scales up. On the other hand if I have a static representations that scales to complex examples it’s much easier to imagine how it can be made editable.<br/><br/>This month I want to try an alternative approach. Instead of building a generic editor I want to pick an example application and code graphical representations and visualizations specifically for this application by hand. The result isn’t an editor yet more a viewer that lets you peek under the hood of the application to see how it works. I want to build a couple applications like this to see if the representations work in different contexts. Once the representations are more proven I can move towards building an unified editor.<br/><br/>What are your approaches to prototyping complex systems while avoiding building a lot of things without knowing if they will work out?

Hello, I recently got an idea to use the spanning tree of a (knowledge) graph to edit a graph like a tree (RoamResearch), but the software's underlaying data structure are graphs. This is a very preliminary demo, it doesn't really show much:

This is slightly more on the business side of things than normal, so let me know if it's not appropriate and I'll delete it.<br/><br/>I'm just finishing up a tech accelerator programme at BetaDen with my tool WhiteBox, which is something like a real-time debugger/execution preview for C &amp; C++, inspired in large part by Bret Victor's <em>Inventing on Principle &amp;</em> Glen Chiacchieri's REPLugger.<br/><br/>There's a final video showcase coming up on the 18th, which is somewhere between a pitch &amp; presentation from each member in the cohort. You're welcome to watch it yourself, and I'd really appreciate it if you could link it to any contacts you have with:<br/>• companies with 1-20 C/C++ programmers<br/>• computer science lecturers/teachers<br/>• anyone with experience in bringing software to market, particularly in the games industry<br/>(obviously only if you think they might be interested, don't spam people :smile:)<br/><br/>The full showcase is on the 18th at 12pm GMT, with a Q&amp;A at 12:55. My 7-minute slot starts at 12:33 if you're not available for the whole thing.<br/><br/>You can sign up for it at either of these links:<br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/betadencohort3-0showcase6774646359124389888/">https://www.linkedin.com/events/betadencohort3-0showcase6774646359124389888/</a><br/><a href="https://www.beta-den.com/showcase/">https://www.beta-den.com/showcase/</a><br/><br/>Cheers everyone!<br/><br/>(P.S. If you want to get/give a better idea of what WhiteBox is, you can see a demo I gave to a programming conference here: <a href="https://media.handmade-seattle.com/whitebox-systems/">https://media.handmade-seattle.com/whitebox-systems/</a>)

I know this isn't quite at the conciseness that is usually shared here, but today we made some strong progress on our Driver SDK design in TypeScript to support really flexible i18n definitions.<br/><br/>I'm quite proud of the conciseness of the demo recording (esp at 1.5x, haha).<br/><br/>• Part 1 of our progress today including an overview of the type checking experience while developing a service driver with the SDK <b><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/d575f780680c48f2a20d7c24ec2e2ace">2021-03 DriverSDK define-service.ts — storytime-pr - Part 1: Type definitions</a></b><br/>• <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/662638c0855b45d485f4ffd1852b9174">Part 2 (english localization)</a> demonstrating the way which a localization can be set up for "wolfram solve" action and some insights into the way param qualification are likely going to evolve in the future<br/>I deeply appreciate all the inspiring links, discussions, and feedback I come across here, and I would love to see if our ideas resonate or inspire anyone else.

I'm new here, I wrote an introduction at <a href="../introduce-yourself/1613857840.000600.html">../introduce-yourself/1613857840.000600.html</a><br/><br/>The more I learn about other people's future-of-coding experiments, the less original my own ideas seem, to the point where many of them don't seem worth sharing anymore. Do I have anything left to add to the conversation? Maybe! At my day job, I work on codebases of up to 100k lines of code, written by small teams, in mainstream languages. Barring a complete revolution, what incremental improvements can I imagine in my daily workflows? I've started sharing these ideas in a series of video talks, and in some cases also with clickable prototypes.<br/><br/>The first video <a href="https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04">https://youtu.be/8hVuOmgcd04</a> is an introduction, but to you here in the Future of Coding community, it <em>might</em> feel like I'm preaching to the choir, so feel free to skip ahead. Video 2, 3 and 4 each explain one standalone idea, like "Stretchy code map" or "Call graph navigator". I'm working on the 5th as we speak. If you prefer to read text over watching video, transcripts are available on my bare-bones website <a href="https://emilprogviz.com/">https://emilprogviz.com/</a><br/><br/>I've worked on this in isolation for years, so now I'd love to hear some encouragement, but even more I'd love to hear which particular ideas you like best, or how you would improve on them!

The Mu computer seems to be making its way fully off third-party operating systems. Here's a demo of some (fairly barebones by the standards of previous demos) operations of the live-updating postfix shell.<br/><br/><a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-shell-20210214</a><br/><br/>If you're curious about the sources, start browsing at <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/shell/line.mu.html</a>. The architecture is much cleaner than the prototype I was working with before. Functions contain lines, lines contain words, words contain gap buffers. Rendering a thing renders its constituent things. Render takes a top-left coordinate and returns a bottom-right coordinate. Each thing knows which constituent thing has its cursor, shows its cursor when rendering, redirects keystrokes to it as they come in.<br/><br/>That's the positive. On the negative side, my experience working with bare metal leads me to despair of ever getting a disk or network. I spent 3 weeks at the start of the year struggling to support a mouse before I gave up. I gave up not because it's impossible to build (I was almost there) but because it's impossible to explain to anyone, at least with my current level of development. There's just too much historical accident in dealing with ancient PS/2 hardware that modern systems continue to pretend to be. And PS/2 was supposed to be easy. At least there's a single lowest-common-denominator way all devices work. With disk and network even that disappears. You need to support umpteen devices. Which means anybody hacking on their own computer now will encounter hardware their computer doesn't have, and which they shouldn't have to care about. In other words, going down this road seems to lead only to where we already are.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about what's next. The thought of giving up on Mu has crossed my mind. It may yet happen. When I started Mu I had programs I wanted to write. It was always a means to an end. Lately I can't remember what they were, and the projects I recall seem obsolete, overtaken by events. There does seem to be one niche where one can write interesting programs about the world without needing to actually, you know, <em>talk</em> to the world over HTTP. That niche is simulation. Building computational models. And it might even be particularly important to the world in the next few years, given the volatility and turmoil I see all around me. As a baby step, here's Conway's Game of Life in Mu without an operating system: <a href="https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13">https://archive.org/details/akkartik-mu-life-2021-02-13</a>. Sources: <a href="http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/life.mu.html">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/baremetal/life.mu.html</a>. For a while I used to implement Life in every new language I learned. Not sure how or why I stopped.

I have been a bit quiet the last month and thought I'd do a quick update.  Typically in January I let myself go off on a tangent or two, and that leads to new discoveries and an opportunity for my brain to rest a bit from the bigger picture.  So in Jan, I contributed some code to Sonic Pi.  It's an opportunity to help a great OS project and contribute some of what I've learned.  Also, selfishly it is a way for me to learn more about a live coding tool and its inner workings (new learnings: OSC is cool as a communcation mechanism, inter process communication isn't as hard as I thought, and vcpkg continues to be a life saver).<br/>My focus was to separate the communication with the Ruby server from the GUI, which is frankly, in need of clean up.  As part of that I added a CI step which built the app and played a chord using Github actions on all 3 platforms, and did a quick demo of combining Sonic Pi and GPU shaders - this functions as an API test and demo; it is not intended to replace the existing UI.<br/>In February<br/>I'm working on a more private project in my spare time.  Some time in March/April when I'm let back into the open again (!) I will get back to my music project, which may well take a turn towards more of a graph-based editor - since I did some research into that over Christmas; getting to the point where I have a flexible UI for displaying nodes, and the ability to drag them around on screen.<br/><a href="https://youtu.be/cl1ABJLMvRc">https://youtu.be/cl1ABJLMvRc</a>

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Mariano Guerra</span> already mentioned it in #linking-together, but I would like to make it "official" here, in the appropriate channel: <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Matija Sosic</span> and I got accepted to current YCombinator batch with Wasp! For those who haven't seen our previous work, we are working on Wasp (<a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a>) - an open source DSL for building full-stack web apps. We have been applying to YC for the last year or so, and finally managed to get in. We are still in pre-alpha, but we are excited about this as it gives us an opportunity to give a harder push to possibly making Wasp become a real thing. This community has been a great help in the last year, both with providing feedback and inspiration, so thanks for that - I always wish to participate more and return back some of that, I hope I will manage to do more of it in the upcoming time.<br/>Btw, in case you would like to show some support, we are on HackerNews right now, on frontpage (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">https://news.ycombinator.com/news</a>)!

Today was a long day, and what better way to relax than having fun renaming files :sweat_smile:<br/>Please don't mind the bug where I try to drag a socket and it somehow moves the node, I was too sleepy to fix it ^^'<br/>This setup basically gets a list of all files in a folder and renames them.

Recently shared this demo of GraphN (VPL made for 3D artists in the computer graphics industry) but forgot to share it here as well :sweat_smile:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FscRL045z4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FscRL045z4</a><br/><br/>This was a nice fun project that aimed to solve a problem that has been requested from the Autodesk Maya team for decades (not kidding): how do you drag an object on any surface, and have it position and align itself to the normal of the polygonal face under your cursor.<br/>The graph that you're seeing basically queries the mouse's screen space position, converts it to world space position, then shoots a ray from the camera to the world to detect the hit position and the orientation/normal of the position that was hit. This position + orientation is then used to set the position/rotation of the object pTorus1 in the scene.<br/><br/>The artist of course doesn't see any of this: they just have basic nodes that allow them to query such data, every node and its properties are rich with descriptions, making it easy to hover over anything and know a) what it does and b) what it expects as a connection.<br/>There's still lots of things that I'd love to improve on the user experience here. If you ask me how satisfied I am with the UX I'd say 30%, because like with any VPL there's always this impression that you're missing something so obvious yet crucial to really changing the game :smile:

I made an experimental interactive &amp; adaptive history of natural language processing (the data science subfield) - but the point isn't the topic, the point is how you can interact with the content, which is an example of what I want to do with all kinds of content - you can view and query it from any perspective:<br/>• <a href="https://www.nlphistory.com/?name=A%20Brief%20General%20History&amp;q0=GetEvents&amp;q0_depth=2&amp;q0_scope=0">get a general summary</a><br/>• see <a href="https://www.nlphistory.com/?name=The%20Road%20to%20Sesame%20Street&amp;q0=GetEverythingOnEntity&amp;q0_entity=Transformer&amp;q0_depth=6&amp;q0_scope=16&amp;h0=0&amp;h0_entity=language%20model&amp;h0_mask=34&amp;h1=1&amp;h1_entity=Transformer&amp;h1_mask=34">how a specific technique developed over time</a>,<br/>• explore varying levels of detail,<br/>• jump around associatively, <br/>You can also just <a href="https://www.nlphistory.com/">start from scratch and make completely new queries</a> (and share a link here for the rest of us).<br/>I'm very curious what you all think of interacting with content like that. Imagine if you could interact with all kinds of content - web content, standard documents, code docs - with an interface like that.<br/><br/>(I hope this is relevant, if it isn't, I'll happily delete it :))

The remote framebuffer protocol (RFB) used by VNC is a quite small and malleable tool for constructing GUIs. It requires only a bi-directional communication channel, which lets it tunnel through just about anything, and makes it very easy to write agnostically in Go.<br/><br/>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote a little program that starts a VNC server for accessing its GUI. I didn’t need any third-party libraries because the protocol is so basic. I view it with macOS's built-in VNC client. And it nests! So parts of the UI are implemented by other processes that also communicate via VNC, which are spliced in.<br/><br/>The source is here: <a href="https://github.com/alltom/dirgui">https://github.com/alltom/dirgui</a> It’s based on <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1348883726642544640">one of Omar’s ideas</a> for turning a directory of files into a form where programs are buttons and other files are editable text fields.<br/><br/>I’m not done experimenting, but I thought this might be a useful epiphany for others!<br/><br/>Here’s a video of the basic form functionality:

(deep breath) herewith my very-informal-first-draft intro / manifesto for zero, the programming language I'm working on. If any of this resonates either positively or negatively, I would love to know more ! In particular, I welcome challenges to any ideas expressed here, to see if they can stand up (or if I can make them stand up). If there's interest, I'll post a demo video of where I am with the implementation.

Hey folks :wave:  Enso (formerly known by many of you as Luna) is nearing release of 2.0. The first single binary installer will be coming in the near future, which should make it a lot easier to use and try out the new Enso. If you’re interested in taking it for a test drive, there’s a signup on the latest devblog, from which we’ll send you the package and docs as soon as it’s ready: <a href="https://medium.com/@enso_org/enso-dev-blog-18th-december-2020-e51e11c02c66">https://medium.com/@enso_org/enso-dev-blog-18th-december-2020-e51e11c02c66</a>

Hi all, I just released a small library for manipulating the DOM using reactive streams: <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/bloom">https://github.com/nonphoto/bloom</a>. partially inspired by <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Steve Krouse</span>’s excellent article <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp">https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp</a>. Thought this community would be interested as I’m looking for feedback and new issues.

Hey guys, here is the full process of solving a sorting problem with MockMechanics. I tried to make a video that's more fun to watch, more "show" less "tell". Any feedback on the new format, length, pacing, etc? Do you prefer the legends to the voiceover? Was anything unclear?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2XgcpGitmM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2XgcpGitmM&amp;ab_channel=MockMechanics</a>

Hey all, this time we are going to brag a little bit :D: after having good success on reddit, we decided to try putting <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/wasp-lang-alpha">Wasp (Alpha) on Product Hunt</a> and we managed to end up on the first place yesterday!!<br/>After pushing hard on development during the summer, we are now again balancing between developing the compiler/language and on the other hand building a community, getting first testers, contributors, so getting some exposure on Product Hunt helps with this.<br/>We are done with "launching" Alpha for now, but we do plan to continue reaching out to people by writing hopefully relevant/valuable blog posts.

Here’s an experiment with structured editing I’ve been working on. I’m skeptically curious about structured editing (text is nice..) so I chose a language with a very simple grammar (CSS).<br/><br/>My current thesis is that any mainstream code editor needs access to text editing (copy-paste, etc). And if both modes are available, would people ever spend time in structural mode?<br/><br/><a href="https://css-structure.netlify.app/">https://css-structure.netlify.app/</a>

Most of what I write about on Codefaster is useful, but not Future of Coding grad changing how people think about code, but my latest series definitely qualifies.<br/>It's about a completely new testing methodology that doesn't use "tests as functions with asserts" like every other testing methodology I've seen, but tests as JSON data.<br/><br/>The coolest part about it? When tests are json data, the computer can generate the "expected test output" for you automatically, so all you need to do is specify the test and the computer fills out what it "should be." Then as a human, you can just verify it with your eyeballs (and in many cases, another program) and not have to type it out or extract correct answers from assert messages.<br/><a href="https://codefaster.substack.com/p/wicked-fast-testing-part-1">https://codefaster.substack.com/p/wicked-fast-testing-part-1</a>

Hey everyone, my business partner <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Harry Brundage</span> and I have been chipping away at a new product called Gadget. It's basically a "backend builder" (hosted db, models, CRUD and custom API, Admin UI) that helps developers build feature rich backends quickly. It speeds up your work by reducing the need for boilerplate, glue code, or bits and pieces you've built a million times (auth, permissions, ...) and it leaves you to code the unique bits of the problem. The best way to think about Gadget is that it's LOW CODE FOR DEVELOPERS. We believe that there's a certain way of thinking, modelling and coding that's necessary to build scalable applications. As such, we're not necessarily huge fans of the no-code movement as a whole, but there are certain aspects we like and we've tried to bring that to a developer audience.<br/><br/>This demo is ten minutes long. And I build a real, live app in that time. The alpha is open to anyone who wants to give us feedback and totally free. DM me if you're interested. Tx for your time and feedback.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.loom.com/share/75738fd721e6447d929ec3e9b8f7c0ea">https://www.loom.com/share/75738fd721e6447d929ec3e9b8f7c0ea</a>

I've been working on an educational programming environment for assessing student competencies with algorithms and data structures (thanks <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Sandra Wiklander</span> for the attached video). One of my goals is to allow students to express their "algorithmic thinking" without having to work with textual syntax, starting with arrays and sorting algorithms. If this works out well, I would like to expand this to support other data structures and more varied computation.<br/><br/>• For a tutorial of the basic operations, see <a href="https://zagie.com/sorting_foc">https://zagie.com/sorting_foc</a> (note that this is the version from the end of the video)<br/>• To just play around with this, try <a href="https://zagie.com/sorting_foc/bubblesort">https://zagie.com/sorting_foc/bubblesort</a>

Just published a new essay y’all might find interesting, on why code is an important medium for communication (no new ideas for this forum, of course :slightly_smiling_face: ) in many cases we get access to more precision than mathematical notation offers. but much more powerfully, code can power many different representations of some idea:<br/><br/>1. the symbols of the themselves<br/>2. mathematical notation generated from the symbols<br/>3. animations<br/>4. graphical renderings <br/>alternate title might have been “Code as a better serialization format for scientific ideas”.

I've been experimenting with RDF and graph databases. I think RDF is a great basis for content management systems. I recently found about TerminusDB which on top of the RDF model provides a git-like storage system (so data can be branched and merged, reverted, etc.). I came up with a little proof of concept for rendering content snippets embedding triple data <a href="https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/NeonTetra">https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/NeonTetra</a>

My quest to build a truly personal computer has hit a major milestone. I finally have a working reference hardware implementation for my uCISC processor at the TinyFPGA Bx board. It runs a battery of instruction tests and computes fib(24) successfully at 16MHz (4 clocks per instruction).

I decided to add a second summary graph to the profiler; this one (shown at the top, in purple) gives a view into the time taken on the audio thread - the critical one for good sound processing.  It is shown as continuous here, but really it is discrete; it is somewhat easier to visualise like this I think.  The graph goes more red the closer the audio thread comes to the max time slice it is given to generate audio.  The image here shows a brief bottleneck which I've zoomed into in the bottom of the profiler.  You can see that the yellow 'Audio' region is much bigger for this particular frame, compared to the next ones.  Although I don't have instrumentation for it yet, I believe this is coinciding with the arrival of the first notes into the graph - since a known problem is that some memory allocation is done at this point on the first run (and this particular stress test is playing many notes all at once).  Just something I know I need to get around to fixing. I'm satisfied the profiler is useful enough to leave alone for now, and move onto other things.

Hi all,<br/>for those who don't yet know, brother and I are working on <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">Wasp</a> - a DSL (domain specific language) for building web apps with as little boilerplate as possible. It is open-source and integrates with React/Node.js/Prisma.<br/>Main hypothesis of the experiment: What if web framework was a DSL (we are not the first ones to try this!)?<br/><br/>About half a year ago I posted a prototype here, and now we have released an Alpha! It is still very early, but we have docs, it can be properly installed, and you can build an app (though it still misses many important features).<br/><br/>Goal of the project and our focus is to make developing web apps as easy as possible, while still being flexible enough to be used for real projects in production. In that sense, I think it should be an ok fit for FoC, since it should allow developers who are not very experienced in web development to build a full-stack production-ready web app by themselves. It does add one more layer of abstraction, but the goal is to reduce knowledge barrier.<br/>Bigger, crazier vision is to one day also build a no-code visual editor on top of Wasp, which would allow non-developers to participate alongside developers. We are thinking this could work very good with Wasp since it is declarative, and if we manage to capture big portion of web app functionality in this declarative code, it could be easier to build such editor on top.<br/><br/>When using Wasp, you write code in Wasp (declarative) and Javascript together.<br/>Compiler implemented in Haskell compiles/transpiles the source code of Wasp project into a human-readable JS based web app (which you don't care about unless you decide to eject -&gt; take the code and leave Wasp).<br/><br/>We started working on Wasp about a year ago, first as a side project and then full time (we are bootstraping), and we are excited to see how far we can get with the whole concept! Right now we are trying to get first testers and contributors (actually got our first contributor couple of days ago wohooo!), while we also keep developing Wasp.<br/><br/>Webpage: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a><br/>Docs: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/</a><br/>Todo App tutorial: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app</a> &lt;- probably best place to get started and try it out<br/>Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a><br/><br/>Thanks for any feedback!

A couple of major milestones this week that video isn't a good fit for:<br/><br/>1. I went back and checked if my old workflow for turning programs into bootable disk images still works, and lo it does. See screenshot.<br/><br/>2. Mu is now <em>millimeters</em> away from being completely memory-safe. While mostly mapping statements 1:1 with machine code instructions. To mark the occasion, here's a summary of the whole language: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/main/mu.md">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/blob/main/mu.md</a>. It's not as expressive as C. But it's safe! That means incorrect programs should error out either at compile time or immediately at run time when they try to do something invalid (such as treat memory for one type as another). (Trading off compiler simplicity for some runtime checks is where Mu differs from Rust.)<br/><br/>(Main project page: <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu">https://github.com/akkartik/mu</a>)

Hi,<br/><br/>Here's my update about the progress that I made last weekend. Sometime ago I started working on <a href="https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner">https://github.com/devhelpr/expressionrunner</a> , which is library to parse and execute expressions<br/>with support for named variables. This weekend I added support for more operators like & | % << >> and so on.<br/>This allows me to extend my tixy land implementation and it is now more in line with the original. But that's not the end goal offcourse.<br/>I want for example to be able to use this expressionrunner for visibility conditions of form fields (in the form-nodes, which is also a new feature) but also in<br/>my "mini excel"-data-grid node as formulas to reference cells (I've already got the basis covered).

I created a new programming language with a friend to see if we could create a compiled language with a simplified bytecode, wrt to traditional languages which allow arbitrary computation that is not guaranteed to halt, that could be automatically parallelized by a VM/runtime (written in Rust :crab:) based on the size and shape of the data.

I added a flame graph along the top of my profiler tool to help me zoom into problem areas.  It occurs to me that a super-useful addition here would be to add a second flame graph for the audio thread.  I will think about it.  Mostly I want to clean up the profiler for now so I can move onto integrating the shader/graphics work back into the tool.

To support an AI demo I'm (slowly) building, I resuscitated out some old GUI library (linux,osx) I was working on 5 years ago (built on top of <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">glfw3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/memononen/nanovg">nanovg</a>). While, all things considered, it's a pretty tangential effort, it's pretty fun to imagine and build GUI components from scratch :heart_eyes: It also mix well with the rest of my code base, which is a huge plus in my books.

I also tried to reimplement tixy.land! Using my own adacraft tool (in that case nearly no special adacraft features has been used, so one can do the same with Scratch). See -> <a href="https://adacraft.org/project/281257812260028929">https://adacraft.org/project/281257812260028929</a><br/><br/>Not sure it has the same spirit as tixy.land though. Because the original idea is to implement the algorithm with a simple formula as a text expression in less than 32 characters, and in my project the formula is programmed with blocks with no limit. But, hey, it was fun to do it!<br/><br/>And with this project I also wanted to explore how to organize and document block programming code à la Scratch to make it more expressive.

I’ve been working on an “expressiveness benchmark” for data analytics DSLs. The goal: for a given framework (SQL, Datalog, vanilla Python, Python with Pandas, etc), what tasks are possible to express, and how hard is each task? Thinking about this as both a learning resource (quickly see lots of examples for a task or language) and an actual benchmark (eg compare lines of code or other metrics). Curious if anyone knows of a resource like this (eg Rosetta Code, TodoMVC).

For a couple of years I've been building up a computing stack without metacircularity, where complex languages are consistently implemented in simpler languages.<br/><br/>For several months now I've been wrestling with a thorny problem in one corner of the core compiler which converts a safe language into unsafe machine code. Today I finally decided to stop agonizing over it, and write up the idea maze to the extent I've explored it.<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/akkartik/mu/issues/45">https://github.com/akkartik/mu/issues/45</a><br/><br/>Comments and suggestions most appreciated. This is a fairly simple compiler as these things go, and I'd be happy to engage with anyone who wants to learn about these beasts in a realistic setting.

It was more a project to play with the CRDT concepts, and an occasion to try Rust and its compilation to WebAssembly. It was a very basic POC for a offline first text editor. It was for a local conference. Here is a link to code: <a href="https://gitlab.com/ogadaki/sunnytech-2019-wuer">https://gitlab.com/ogadaki/sunnytech-2019-wuer</a>

This is a prototype I’ve been working on for browsing and reading code. The main ideas I’m exploring are spatial organization, abstracting away files, and path-aware browsing. It’s currently setup with the react-reconciler codebase and the linked canvas does a tiny tour of React hooks.<br/><br/>I'd love any questions/feedback.

Hi all -- we just released the alpha of <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, a JS library for interacting with a permissionless decentralized identity infrastructure (closets analogy: decentralized-keybase-as-a-service) that makes it easy to link accounts, keys, metadata, profiles and other resources (e.g., databases, verifications) together in a user-managed way.<br/><br/>The goal is enabling apps and users to manage information directly on an open and identity-centric network, without silos or trusted servers, and in the background of whatever tech stack/data models you're using today. Doing so makes critical info user-controllable, interoperable across any context, and much easier to build with and collaborate on. It's pretty early and works best with key-based auth right now, but working with partners to make it easy to use with social logins/magic links soon. Would love any and all feedback if this fits the goals of projects you are working on!<br/><br/>More context here if you're interested (fair warning: a bit of marketing-speak and jargon) -- <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85</a>

A quick update on the Layered Text concept I posted last month: I'm working on putting together a better demo which i'll post in the #two-minute-week channel once it's ready... but at least this shows off a little bit of it (including how I decided to deal with issues like the lack of an absolute coordinate system). Big shout-outs to <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Christopher Galtenberg</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Maughan</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Stefan Lesser</span>, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Chris Granger</span> and everyone else who chimed in with their contributions to the stimulating discussion that ensued. You gave me the energy to keep moving forward with this (a testament to how amazing this community is!)

Hey guys, a sneak peak into the upcoming open source tool we are working on. It is called <tt>docly</tt> and we are trying to generate one line description of python functions given the code. At the moment it can do something like this<br/><br/>Given this -<br/><pre>def stem(text):<br/>        if not dostem:<br/>            return text<br/>        return ' '.join([ps.stem(w) for w in text.split()])<br/><br/>    return stem(white_space_fix(remove_punc(lower(s))))</pre><br/>It can predict the doc string to be - <tt>return lowercase and stemmed version of string text</tt> :slightly_smiling_face:

I made a Chrome extension which reads websites aloud (including slack) and has, I believe, a convenient interface based on keyboard shortcuts (change tempo and pitch, pause/resume, previous / next sentence, toggle auto-scroll). Although this is not a programming tool, it might be useful for everyone who reads a lot of texts and sometimes wants to continue consuming a text while giving rest to one's eyes.<br/><br/>Concerning interface design, the one thing which is somewhat novel (or at least not mainstream): buttons' names on the widget contain keyboard shortcuts themselves (like "Space"), while functional description (like "pause/resume") is at a side. The motivation is to emphasize and encourage using keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse-clicking on buttons. Do you find this approach useful?<br/><br/>I would be happy to hear feedback of any kind. (This is my first software product which is indended for a potentially wide audience.)<br/><br/>Install: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-with-auto-lang/iaeiplcjdnogoipoblmicfocnhfobpmi">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-with-auto-lang/iaeiplcjdnogoipoblmicfocnhfobpmi</a><br/><br/>Demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnxh91ryrdU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnxh91ryrdU</a> (I speak there in Russian, but the video and the widget itself are self-explanatory.)<br/><br/>P.S.

Hey all,<br/><br/>I want to present you my new project, <a href="https://adacraft.org/">adacraft</a>! Which is a slightly modified Scratch with new extensions.<br/><br/>This project can be seen as a first step for me to gather user feedback and experiment things on "easier programming".<br/><br/>Using Scratch gives a ready to use programming environment for "non-experts" and adding new extensions and modifying Scratch a bit allows to quickly experiment new use cases, new tools, new way to program. Of course at some point Scratch will be limiting, but I am sure there is enough room for fun experiments!<br/><br/>So far, I have added some AI extensions and a <a href="https://www.croquet.io/">Croquet</a> extension. An AI extension that uses <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a> models for image classification and an other for face recognition (based on ml5.js, more to come from this library). The Croquet one is very experimental but it is usable for very basic inter-project communication, and the main contribution (nearly all) comes from Yoshiki Ohshima, of the Croquet team.<br/><br/>I have some ideas for new extensions (like, why not, generating HTML/DOM, and, why not, à la Vue.js) and would love to hear from you if you think of something to experiments with some Scratch "constraints".<br/><br/>And of course any feedback and thoughts are very welcome! :pray: :relaxed:

What started with me reverse engineering notion became a data-first recursive UI resolver I called <b><a href="https://github.com/den1k/root">root</a></b>.<br/><br/>Here's how it differs from most common technologies today:<br/>• Approaches to UI development like react.js + graphQL require UI components to request data in a shape that satisfies the UI tree. This means the shape of the data is determined by the UI tree. Root takes an inverse approach where the UI tree is determined by the shape of the data.<br/>• A major benefit of this approach is that the UI layout is thus entirely determined by data, data that can be traversed, transformed and stored in arbitrary ways and by arbitrary means.<br/>• This is powerful for unstructured, user-determined, block-based UI's like rich documents (think Roam Research, Notion etc.) enabling queries and functions that, based on users' demands, derive the optimal presentation of a document.<br/>It packs a few more punches. The best example is probably this <a href="https://den1k.github.io/root/rich-document.html">notion-like demo</a> in about 200 LoC (<a href="https://github.com/den1k/root/blob/master/dev/examples/rich_document/views.cljs">source</a>). Github repo <a href="https://github.com/den1k/root">here</a>.

A year ago I was working on VR Visual Scripting in Facebook Horizon.  They've recently started to share some more information leading up to Facebook Connect.  I figured the scripting system would either be largely the same, or entirely rewritten since I left.  It seems like it's mostly in tact based on documentation shared (<a href="https://support.oculus.com/872960043229069/">https://support.oculus.com/872960043229069/</a>)

I've been doing more and more writing lately, and have been wishing for a tool that allows me to write my outlines, drafts, and final compositions in the same editor window with the ability to toggle any of those "layers" on and off at will, merge them, copy selections to new layers, etc. It would work sort of like Photoshop but for writing... I have a feeling these principles could also work as an IDE extension (imagine being able to hide the "code" layer and show only the "comments" layer, or the "documentation" layer). Curious to hear your thoughts, or whether anyone else is working on something similar?

Hey all. I've put together a small Powerpoint (25 slides) demonstrating my PL's architecture using Flappy Bird pseudocode. I'm looking for some early feedback before posting it here. Please DM me if you're game.

I'm prototyping a new approach to drawing dynamic pictures with direct manipulation. So far, I've been calling it "Apparatus with Magnets". We'll see if the name... sticks. :wink:<br/><br/>Here's a "project proposal": <a href="https://www.notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-077e72bc1ebf4f7a9ec512ef76d47994">https://notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-Intro-2e32af5b59b64a45b3b203408374a56e</a><a href="https://www.notion.so/Apparatus-with-Magnets-077e72bc1ebf4f7a9ec512ef76d47994">….</a> Progress is slow but steady.

Like handwritten notes but want to use a tool that doesn't support them?<br/><br/>I've put together this super simplified drawing tool that makes it really easy to jot down an idea and copy it to virtually anything that supports image pasting.<br/><br/>I call it Clipnote!<br/><br/><a href="https://clipnote.glitch.me/">https://clipnote.glitch.me/</a><br/><br/>Wondering whether to keep it this simple or add extra stuff like color selection (maybe just a few presets dualtones), undo, multiple snapshots, eraser, etc.<br/><br/>PS. Pen pressure is supported.

I spend most of my time working in JS codebases in VSCode and wasn’t happy with how I navigate around in my codebases.<br/>So started working on an extension called Waypoint - <a href="https://github.com/Raathigesh/waypoint">https://github.com/Raathigesh/waypoint</a><br/>For now Waypoint provides symbol search and symbol bookmarks.

Update on making web applications self-editable. Now you can edit the editor with the editor. I think I've hit the end of the line on this feasibility prototype. If I'm going to keep going, it'll need to be in a neater, more elegant architecture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZDhJLdhSvGs">https://youtu.be/ZDhJLdhSvGs</a>

Did this little prototype to find out how difficult it would be to automatically add scrubbability to numbers in arbitrary text in JS/HTML.<br/>Turns out not too much, would love to see this in online experimental editors such as CodePen, JSFiddle, etc.<br/><br/>With some extra contextual info Bret Victor would likely approve of this... now that's the hard part though :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/><a href="https://codepen.io/domjancik/pen/XWdjrQv">https://codepen.io/domjancik/pen/XWdjrQv</a>

If you want feedback, collaborators, high-fives, or just a place to drop your latest output, this is the place.<br/><br/>This channel is especially sensitive to tone, so please keep things positive and constructive. Critique is great, criticism is not.<br/><br/>• If your work is more about programming as practiced today than programming of a hypothetical <em>much better</em> future, please share it in #present-company. This is a fuzzy boundary that we'll more clearly establish over the coming months, so if in doubt, by all means post here.<br/>• Blog posts about your own FoC work are welcome here. If you'd just like to direct people to your blog post about the FoC more generally, not about your specific FoC project work, that probably belongs in #linking-together.

In terms of experimental development tooling, I put out a VSCode extension a little while ago that focuses on mapping conceptual interactions with Vuejs + TailwindCSS into a few semantic keystrokes through AST manipulation. I don't have a video, but the README has a few GIFs showing it in action. The CSS interaction cycle seems to me to be somewhat novel, though underdeveloped.<br/><a href="https://github.com/cameronrking/olympus">https://github.com/cameronrking/olympus</a>

<b>The open application: making websites user-editable with no special effort.</b> This is a feasibility prototype built for Svelte. The core of it is quite simple. At build time, it transforms component definitions to fetch their dependent components from a dependency store rather than importing them from the filesystem. Component source files are emitted as part of the build, and the Svelte compiler is added to the page. Now you can pull up the source of any component, make changes, and rebuild it from within the browser.<br/><br/>This week, I'm working on building experimental development tooling from within this architecture, so hopefully I'll be able to share more interesting functionality by the weekend.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/P-ZHjVa2OYk">https://youtu.be/P-ZHjVa2OYk</a>

I've been trying to put more of my work into words, so I've built a blog. I've started at the beginning and quite simply and hope to expand to more interesting topics in the future. Let me know what you think of this first post (it has some interactive code examples for everyone who likes to play around :wink: ).<br/><a href="https://irreactive.com/declarative-apis">https://irreactive.com/declarative-apis</a>

I’m writing a paper for the Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants workshop (<a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2020#Call-for-Papers">https://2020.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2020#Call-for-Papers</a>) about what makes ownership in Rust challenging to use. For example, how incompleteness of static analysis makes it hard to interpret type errors as the fault of the user or the compiler. I’d love to get feedback on:<br/>• Does the process of interpreting a type error make sense? Does it ring true to your own experience (in Rust or other languages?)<br/>• Did you learn something new? Does this paper help you understand/frame the usability challenges about Rust specifically, or potentially a different language?

I've been working on editor integration for the alv livecoding language, and finally have something worth showing. Alv scripts being a bunch of stateful pieces, <b>seeing</b> that state feels like a gamechanger to me, even more than I originally anticipated. I feel like this single demo clip might now show what alv is about better than my attempts at communicating it verbally or textually; maybe those who have followed along with my (few) videos in <a href="#C0120A3L30R">#C0120A3L30R</a> or the other posts can confirm or deny that?<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/S0lll0s/status/1283349999213051904">https://twitter.com/S0lll0s/status/1283349999213051904</a>

Hi, I've just published another experiment and would like to hear what you think. It's a simple text editor that uses different fonts depending on the type of syntactic element (e.g. comments use sans-serif, punctuation uses monospace). The experiment is online so that you play around with it and I've even managed to write some text about the experiment this time.<br/>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/FKohlgrueber/status/1280881676500054016">https://twitter.com/FKohlgrueber/status/1280881676500054016</a><br/>Github: <a href="https://github.com/fkohlgrueber/edix-1">https://github.com/fkohlgrueber/edix-1</a><br/>Live Demo: <a href="https://fkohlgrueber.github.io/edix-1/">https://fkohlgrueber.github.io/edix-1/</a>

Distributed systems struggle with the evolution of their data types over time. The classical solution is carefully orchestrated database migrations, API deprecations, and the like. In decentralised software many of these techniques do not apply. How then, should we manage change over time in evolving systems? We're exploring this question at Ink &amp; Switch with the Cambria project.

Hi everyone, long-time lurker here. I wanted to share a project I worked on for my PhD and hear your thoughts. It is a platform for quickly assembling web apps out of a new kind of software module we call a concept. Concepts are full-stack units of end-user functionality. For example, a comment concept manages the creation and display of comments, and a posting concept lets users create posts.<br/><br/>Each concept exports a set of components, which are similar to components in modern web frameworks like React. A key difference, however, is that concept components have an associated server-side action, which can be synchronized with other actions. In our platform, called Déjà Vu, a developer builds an app by including concepts and synchronizing the server-side actions of components. To assemble apps you only write JSON, HTML, and CSS—no server-side code or client-side JavaScript is required.<br/><br/>Webpage: <a href="https://deja-vu-platform.com">https://deja-vu-platform.com</a><br/>Paper: <a href="https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf">https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf</a><br/>Slides of the most recent talk: <a href="https://spderosso.github.io/slides/thesisdefense20.pdf">https://spderosso.github.io/slides/thesisdefense20.pdf</a><br/>Demo of the graphical environment (developed by Barry, a master student in our group): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10IexBI5v-A&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10IexBI5v-A&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br/><br/>If you have any feedback, let me know. Also, if you are working on modularity/software composition, I’d love to see what you are up to!

I've been working on a deep learning project that feels relevant to this community, and would love to hear some of your thoughts. I'm training a neural network to translate abstract syntax trees into images (and then back into ASTs since the whole system is an autoencoder.) Right now this is limited to simple arithmetic statements like <tt>c / (a+b)</tt>, but the goal is to try it out on larger expressions with a greater vocabulary, so that you can turn larger ASTs into images. In addition to being really fun and interesting, it feels like it could offer ideas for visual programming?<br/>Visualized here is an interpolation between different expression trees. Still kind of rough around the edges.

I've put together a few slides about Glance's goals and strategy. Questions and criticism welcome. TLDR: The Glance project aims to "dramatically increase the programming capabilities of everyone (especially beginners) by creating a visual programming inspired software creation tool that is both easy to learn and powerful enough to solve complex problems." <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vm0uyc_swsSMTe_uIigCH-TBWj3QAX_4wYFoamFgI4w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vm0uyc_swsSMTe_uIigCH-TBWj3QAX_4wYFoamFgI4w/edit?usp=sharing</a>

I'm working on some approaches to extract sub-page/window frames out of existing apps. These frames would then exist as separate windows locally which you could arrange however you prefer, and can also be shared with other people, snapshot for archiving, etc. It would be a huge help to hear what people might want to use this ability for, so I recently tweeted to collect some feedback. Happy to have replies in a thread here or on Twitter, whichever you prefer.<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/jryans/status/1266166240114020352">https://twitter.com/jryans/status/1266166240114020352</a>

Hi, I've only recently discovered this community but feel like you guys could enjoy a tool I've been working on for the past year and a half which I'm publicly releasing today.<br/><br/>It's called Schéma, it's a visual programming tool combining Block and Node based approaches with focus on direct manipulation, instant feedback of each step in the processing, smooth ux and versatility, even though the first focus of it was light control (DMX, LEDs).<br/><br/>It's developed from the ground up in the VL visual programming language. <br/><br/>I'd love if you tried it out and tell me what you're enjoying, what not and what you can imagine doing with such a tool :relaxed:<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/YSm8iA8DoIc">https://youtu.be/YSm8iA8DoIc</a><br/><br/>More information, including comprehensive documentation, available at <a href="https://schema.scenic.tools/">https://schema.scenic.tools/</a>

Some people asked about the layout system, here is a 2 minute video showing why you want to design things using proportions rather than pixels. Screen densities vary from 100 to 500 dpi nowadays, so you can't ever use pixels and expect it to look nice across all devices.<br/><br/>In this video i show a tool i just built that lets you visualize your output as if it was on different devices. This tool is in the Beads SDK example set called "cycler". The way it works is interesting; you compile two programs at once; one is the "monitor" program that gets control of the screen, and then runs a slave program inside a smaller window. Javascript has iFrames and so on, but doesn't really have the concept of a dpi inside a window, which is a huge hindrance. Anyway i hope you find it interesting.  <a href="https://youtu.be/AoACdQSSsZM">https://youtu.be/AoACdQSSsZM</a>

Here is a 1 minute demo of the time travel debugging feature in Yazz, which is a rapid application development tool in progress at <a href="http://Yazz.com">Yazz.com</a>. I am not affiliated with the Yazz project, but thought it would be fun for the FoC group to see how some people are attacking that crucial problem of going in reverse. This demo shows a bubble sort, and tracks each line of the code as it executes, and shows the changing state of the data. The concept of having one little square's position vertically be based on the line number of the code doesn't scale well, but for small examples it is very cute.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/PKJO1rlJGC4">https://youtu.be/PKJO1rlJGC4</a>

Morning FoC — I hope all are healthy during these trying times. My thoughts and positive vibes go out to those impacted. — I’ve put together another demonstration of Storyscript, illuminating the first <b>dialog-driven development</b> studio blending NLP+DSL+Notebook.

<b>Feedback request:</b> brother and I just finished first prototype of Wasp - higher-level programming language for building web apps - would love to get your feedback!<br/>Webpage (with demo): <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev">https://wasp-lang.dev</a>, Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a> .<br/>We are still very early / experimental, and current demo is yet far away from our vision, but it should illustrate some basic concepts.<br/>Our main challenge is designing the language so it captures the correct abstractions and is easy to use, while also making it flexible enough to be useful. Plan for now is to find inspiration in current popular frameworks and similar solutions + guide development by specific use cases (we started with Todo App).<br/>Thanks!

Often, when people come across Glamorous Toolkit, the attention is focused on how we see the environment and how this can change programming. At the same time, it might be less obvious that to make GT work, we build a whole new graphical stack that has the property of always relying on one single rendering tree.<br/><br/>We now put together an article describing what one rendering tree means and the doors it opens for creating new kinds of 2D interfaces. I think this might be of interest for some people here. Feedback would be very much welcome.<br/><a href="https://medium.com/feenk/one-rendering-tree-918eae49bcff?source=friends_link&sk=c0551af8504ee919c4d8c54c390eef49">https://medium.com/feenk/one-rendering-tree-918eae49bcff?source=friends_link&sk=c0551af8504ee919c4d8c54c390eef49</a>

Hi all! Long time lurker here. In my spare time, I've been working on a web app for generating a customizable UI solely from an OpenAPI spec of your REST api. Its in the <em>very</em> early stages, but I'd very much appreciate any feedback nonetheless. App can be found <a href="https://condescending-brown-89fb8e.netlify.com/">here</a>. Try out the tutorial and let me know what you think!

I've written some posts about "Observable for Jupyter Users," wondering if people find them useful.<br/>• Differences between Jupyter and Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/b00406054cfb4875">https://observablehq.com/d/b00406054cfb4875</a><br/>• Visualize a data frame with Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/eceaa744227c4fea">https://observablehq.com/d/eceaa744227c4fea</a><br/>• Interactivity in Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/c4e1459a8a99cdaf">https://observablehq.com/d/c4e1459a8a99cdaf</a><br/>• Bonus: JavaScript for Python Programmers: <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/5e82392bae5fb729">https://observablehq.com/d/5e82392bae5fb729</a><br/>I'd be particularly interested in whether you think I'm identifying the differences in workflow in a digestible way. The goal is that these are tutorials, not marketing documents, if there's a difference. I guess they're marketing documents for programmers, not CEOs.

Hi! Operon 0.5.0 is out, find it from <a href="https://operon.io">https://operon.io</a> (Java-binary and pdf-booklet). It is also the first public release and I'm hoping for feedback on the most rudimentary things; did you get the queries running (if you had a chance to try)? What was your initial impression on the language? Did you encounter anything illogical or that you could consider as possible design flaw? I have not yet documented everything, so there's more to come on later releases. Also none of the components were yet released, so it is just the core that is out now. Love to hear back from you! :grin:

Idea - use software applications to design programming languages.  I think we should be taking existing software applications and working backward to work out how to create better programming languages and development tool. So the output of a programming language is a software application, it is easy to find valuable software applications. So if we were to work backward from a collection of software applications to create new programming languages, we could measure if the new language was better or not. We could measure the number of code statements, we could estimate code complexity and development time of different languages. I feel we have the Microsoft Excel problem at the moment, we spend a lot of time arguing about different language innovations, developers in Microsoft famously got distracted by spending a lot of time talking about feature ideas they could add to Excel. Microsoft eventually solved this problem by watching people use Excel. They discovered that most of the debates they had been having were a waste of time and often of near zero value to end users. Microsoft, almost overnight, switched to assessing innovation ideas against current end user solutions. ... Interestingly, we already have current end user solutions available to us, in the form of software applications.  ...  This is a random idea I had, have not spent much time checking the feasibility. ... Thoughts, feedback welcome.

not necearily future of coding, but "making the present suck less" :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>&gt; we want to avoid having to introduce the syntax early on, but we want to be able to transition to it slowly and maximize the amount of things they learn to apply once they move to writing HTML by hand, that's why I'm doing a prototype of the tool we may use, I recorded a video with an overview and the ideas behind it:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqTLUAWCM4M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqTLUAWCM4M</a>

Couple of months ago I made a presentation in my university called "Towards efficient development tools".<br/>Now it is finally published on YouTube. I would love to hear your feedback.<br/><br/>In presentation I tried to show the possibility and need for better tools. I did a short overview of existing FoC projects, talked a bit about project I am working on: a generic tree editor (structure editor) that doesn't tied up to any PL. I also talked about idea of designing PL by balancing Order and Chaos, ideas that I got from Jordan Peterson.<br/><br/>I believe that breakaway from text-based editing towards structure-based is an inevitable event for future of programming.<br/>I also have some other ideas about programming languages that I would like to build on top of this tree editing platform, but it is not covered in presentation.<br/><br/>I decided to make an academic career, that's why I've enrolled to university.<br/>This presentation is small step that I've attempted towards that direction.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE</a>

Just posted a new example showing the physical units of measurement feature in my Beads language, which tracks units at runtime (by storing the exponents of the component physical unit terms along with the value). A few languages have included physical units, but it is extremely rare to track the units at runtime.

I just peeked at bitspark. A huge amount of work in that product. I looked at the code, very cleverly obfuscated. Was more than surprised to find Maltese strings inside the program, clearly the work of someone from that tiny island. First time in fact i have seen Maltese. Words like xahar Għada means Tomorrow month. The h with a bar is not a common letter!.

One of the big questions every next-gen language has to face sooner or later, is: Is it a suitable replacement for any of the top 3 languages in use which are JavaScript, Java, and Python?   Those languages have huge entrenched user bases; with tons of code, examples, and libraries. I don't think you can find a higher risk project than tackling any of those 3 languages head-on, but hey isn't that the job of the future of coding group, to spawn the replacement for these ancient yet powerful languages?  If we can't topple one or more of these giant towers of code, are we making any significant progress?<br/><br/>As as test case i took a very small Python program that draws a little tree, and recoded it in the Beads language, and did a comparison of the complexity of the API calls used to create the program. This is a subjective task of course, as assigning points to various API calls is debatable, but one has to at least make a stab at measurement, because without measurement there is no science; just fad and fashion. The two programs are really quite different, and I think just this tiny example shows the vast gulf between notations. The detailed comparison is at <a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/blob/master/Example%20-%20Xmas%20Tree/docs/comparison_with_python.md">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/blob/master/Example%20-%20Xmas%20Tree/docs/comparison_with_python.md</a>

It is fun to consider the future of computing, but people in the trenches who are trying to do basic automation need the basics handled as well, so i made an example in Beads showing the dynamic nature of layouts, where you can make a single form that adapts to whatever screen layout, orientation, and pixel density it encounters, so a single code base can run on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Mobile forms are tricky because the label moves above the field due to the narrowness. Anyway if people are interested in taking Beads for a spin, it is downloadable at <a href="http://www.beadslang.com/downloads/beads.zip">http://www.beadslang.com/downloads/beads.zip</a>. See the README file at the to level for installation instructions.

Over the last year I've spent a lot of time outside my area of expertise, mining some seemingly unrelated fields for inspiring ideas that can be combined with what we try to do here. One particularly deep rabbit hole I fell into was linguistics. As I'm slowly climbing my way back up into our world, I started trying to put some of the insights I bring with me from down there into a blog series.<br/><br/>My goal is to make some of the concepts I learned about more accessible to us designing and developing software. I think there is a lot that can be useful for dreaming up and building a more humane and democratized future of programming.<br/><br/>I start with very basic stuff, and go slowly, so there isn't much yet. I also try to keep the posts short (500-1000 words, ~3-6 minutes reading time). There are three of them right now, and you can start here: <a href="https://stefan-lesser.com/2019/12/06/structure-and-behavior/">https://stefan-lesser.com/2019/12/06/structure-and-behavior/</a><br/><br/>Would love to hear what you think. Thank you!

These days, I try to explore a place way, way further left on the graphics side.  For example, to program something similar to factorial... Measure out a length.  Rotate a duplicate ninety degrees.  Draw the missing edge to make this a right equilateral triangle.  Cut some lengths out of the triangle at a regular interval.  Product those into a many dimensional cube.  Flatten.

Hi everyone, a few days ago I released <a href="https://github.com/ad-si/RosettaGit">https://github.com/ad-si/RosettaGit</a>. It’s a fork of Rosetta Code (which probably many of you know).<br/><br/>In comparison to Rosetta Code, in RosettaGit all code is stored and hosted in a repository on GitHub instead of a MediaWiki. This has following advantages:<br/><br/>• Code can be edited with proper text editors<br/>• Continous integration and delivery can be used to ensure a high code quality<br/>• All infrastrucuture for git (e.g. GitHub) simplifies further development<br/>• Faster load times as pages are only rebuilt after a change<br/>For a more in depth explanation you can also check out my build log at <a href="https://adriansieber.com/announcing-rosettagit/">https://adriansieber.com/announcing-rosettagit/</a><br/><br/>I think this could me an amazing resource, but I need your help to expand and maintain it!

The core idea is that there's no special ui for stuff like the about page and open source licenses page, they are all presented as data and as such, they can be used like any other thing in the application (in the video I create a chart aggregating the dependencies by license type), I also show the introduction of the link data type as a core type and two new functions that operate on the new type (get link title and get link address)

For anyone who was just in the symposium, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Garth Goldwater</span> asked for a beta invite to Dark. If you're interested in a beta invite, right now we're focused on onboarding slackbot projects.<br/><br/>If you have a Slackbot - please just fill out: <a href="https://darklang.com/beta">https://darklang.com/beta</a> and leave a note that you came from FoC (this is just to make my life easier - they go to me + Victoria + Jessica to organize and schedule). If you do that, I'll commit that you'll get an onboarding next Tues, Wed, or Fri :)<br/><br/>We've also just released a new version of the editor that feels more fluid vs. structural, so you'll get to give feedback on that. :star2:

I've been pretty quiet lately because I've had my head down working on WhiteBox, a tool to show you how your (compiled) code behaves as you write it (similar to Glen Chiacchieri's REPLugger, if you saw that).<br/>I'd like some feedback on what people would like to see more of. I'm thinking about doing a livestream presentation this weekend... I might do some UI mockups to give you an idea of what I'm aiming for (and to get some criticism)<br/>Apologies for the silence, I wanted to get something up quickly... hopefully it makes sense.<br/>EDIT: video replaced with a version with commentary below

Just posted a handy color picker utility web app written in beads that lets you copy a color name or Hex value to the clipboard. It sorts the colors nicely, and resizes to a very wide range of window sizes. I believe that it is within 20% of the theoretical minimum program word count to achieve this task. 0 external dependencies, and only about a dozen functions total, how much simpler can it get? Anyway please check out the code at <a href="https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/tree/master/Example%20-%20Color%20Picker">https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples/tree/master/Example%20-%20Color%20Picker</a> or just use the utility at <a href="http://beadslang.com/apps/color_picker/picker.html">http://beadslang.com/apps/color_picker/picker.html</a>

Hi all, just launched some new features at <a href="https://storyforj.com/">https://storyforj.com/</a> .... AND we're now in public beta (this means you can sign up and try the platform out). If you're looking for something analogous to a stateful interactive doc or non-linear presentation this would be the tool for you.<br/><br/>Anyways, would really love feedback on the tool itself, and the way we're describing ourselves. We've described ourselves as a "simple app builder", "micro-experience creator" and "interactive presentation" before. It seems that in FoC land it's actually quite difficult to describe to end users what you're building. We've found that a seemingly straightforward descriptions like "app builder" to us, often means nothing to an end user.

Anybody have a half hour to read a draft blog post? <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/mu-2019">http://akkartik.name/post/mu-2019</a>. It deals with low-level programming details, but I don't want readers to have knowledge of low-level programming.

I'm building a typed file-system to replace application-centrism in the spirit of end-user-programming.<br/><br/>A lot of ideas are jumbled up together in this project, which makes it a bit hard to talk about, but the core of it is that content is stored in typed 'facets', and the system has a built-in (aspirationally user-extensible) library of known transformations it can apply to these; such as for example rendering markdown to DOM, executing Lua or JavaScript, thumbnailing pictures, loading remote content via links etc. These transformations are automatically combined and searched; whenever content is displayed or embedded, the code embedding the content can ask for a target format/constraint set and the system takes care of e.g. fetching a remote script file, executing it to obtain a markdown string, then rendering that string to a DOM element which can be included (this example would have the type string <tt>URL -&gt; application/javascript -&gt; text/markdown</tt>).<br/><br/>Another big part is that these facets are attached not just to leaf nodes in the tree (conventional files) but also to the folders. This means that any container can be scripted, for examle a 'pictures' folder can be built to show either a grid view or a slideshow of  images it contains, or an UI to switch between both, and the images inside can be images stored on disk or links to images on the network, and the folder doesn't need to care.<br/><br/>The system has been up and running as my website for a while now, running either server side (static html output) or clientside (live DOM output) but with no ability to edit content. For my Bachelor Work I am now planning to add editing capabilities in the front-end, that should also be scriptable similar to how the output has been scriptable so far - the idea being that this would enable the creation of e.g. a document/folder behaving like an MS Word document, containing images, videos and text, but being editable in page layout; or for example a pinwall/moodboard for arranging snippets on a pannable canvas etc.<br/><br/>If anyone is interested to see some examples, the website is <a href="https://s-ol.nu">https://s-ol.nu</a> and comes with a little inspector to look at the system contents. The code for everything is also public here: <a href="https://git.s-ol.nu/mmm/">https://git.s-ol.nu/mmm/</a><br/><br/><b>If this rings any bells with anyone, it would be very helpful if you could point me to any theory that I could relate to in my thesis.</b> Thanks!

A fairly timeless syntax for programming in raw machine code: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/102825992961303855">https://mastodon.social/@akkartik/102825992961303855</a>. It's for a fixed processor, but the general approach (numbers, metadata, strings, tests, blocks) should apply to any processor. It takes little code to support, and provides decent ergonomics. Good power to weight ratio, if I do say so myself.

A very powerful and nice combination of the spreadsheet and the database. I believe that Tableau and some other very highly funded startups are pursuing this very combination of things.

Boy is Kartik right about that! When I suggested the other day in a Reddit forum that one could measure, approximately, the error propensity of a language, and the mean time to repair by someone other than the author i was practically tarred and feathered. Programmers may be mostly unique like snowflakes, but if you put a bunch of programmers on the same exact task, and give them different tools, their productivity will be wildly different. I once worked a huge project for IBM. They needed a sequel to their very popular DisplayWrite 4 word processor because WordPerfect will killing them, and in previous decades under Thomas J Watson Jr, there was a practice in IBM that any important project was done by 3 different labs, and the winner with the first/best product, depending on what they were after, would get promotions and staff expansions, and the losing lab would be shuffled a bit like a losing soccer team. A very radical approach that kept internal competition at a high pitch, even when IBM was in its day a giant monopoly. Because IBM is only a mere shadow of its former greatness people don't understand how radical a structure IBM followed, with its technical ladder paying as well as the sales ladder. Who else does this in modern times? Anyway the three teams used different languages and different approaches, and my firm used Modula-2 while the others used C, and we kicked their butts, because Modula-2 is a far superior language to C, particularly as the code grows to large size. More companies should try the multiple team approach. Nothing stimulates human performance like a fair competition, where the stakes are high, but the playing field is level. And to bring it back to Kartik's point, the Academics don't have much at stake in their projects,  and often don't care if anyone uses any of their stuff. These category theorists really drive me over the bend. Please show me how functors make my tictactoe game easier to write and easier to understand...

Prof. Wirth's Lilith computer is another miracle of economy, and was sold for a few years. It used Oberon and was inspired by his time spent at Xerox PARC. Oberon is a very clever language; i used its predecessor Modula-2 for 20 years to great success. Wirth made a deadly mistake when he removed enumerated types from Oberon 1 which prevented large code bases written in Modula-2 to cross over. Oberon 2 fixed it, but the damage was already done.

just a note, I'm not against finding good representations and trying to share them, for example <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">https://arrow.apache.org/</a> and some shared IRs on ML/AI are interesting, also a lot came out of LLVM sharing compiler representations, but trying to optimize one representation at a single level by forcing all code that uses it to adapt to that representation doesn't feel like a way to allow more expressivity, easier/simpler/higher level programming

as far as I know most drawing pipelines (I'm not an expert here) go through different stages with different representations that make it easy to do the operations that are important at that stage, so the best representation depends on where you are and what you want to do, I don't think you can avoid going from one represenation to the other unless you want to operate in a represenation that is not the most adapted to the task at hand

now, say you find the canonical representation for a square and you really can share your representation, you may many times want to operate on a sequence of those squares, vectorized instructions on the cpu may be handy, but they expect arrays of points, now the best representation of a square is 4 arrays of points, should we? are we going to force all our abstractions to handle 4 arrays because we feel that's a better representation?

you app has a cannonical representation for a square, are you sure that all the layers up until the pixels are drawn on the screen share your repesentation? even if some share the representation, you can't pass a pointer to the data, because it crosses many boundaries and even if it did, the other layers don't know about the layout of your representation, that means that the quest to find the true canonical representation of a square to avoid 2 additions/substractions will end up being transformed and copied N times until it ends on the screen

In my experience, the math works out best for pair of opposing vectors. I use: rect.min.x, rect.min.y, rect.max.x, rect.max.y. The size is (rect.max - rect.min). The centre is (rect.min + rect.max)/2. The bounding box of a list of rectangles is the minimum of the min fields, together with the maximum of the max fields. I use the word "rect" in 2 dimensions, for an axis-aligned rectangle, and "box" in 3 dimensions, for an axis aligned cuboid.

I've written the first blog post about my own future of coding project, the artistic programming tool Hest. In the post I describe how the programming model emerges from geometric primitives, the inspirations behind the editor GUI, the design of the time travel capability, and end with a problem that emerged from the intersection of two of my favorite features. I welcome feedback about both the design of Hest and the problem I'm currently grappling with, plus the blog post itself. I do a lot of writing but not a lot of blogging so suggestions about how to better utilize the medium, or places where you lose the thread of thought, would be lovely. Thanks!

Surely, surely, the math works out best for pair of opposing vectors!  :wink:  No need to limit yourself to vec2 or even that one vector be relatively less than the other...

for example, no-one that writes GLSL or any other shader language would dream of treating a rectangle as anything other than position/size. That is easy because in glsl everything that works on scalars also works on vectors. If you're doing graphics programming in a language that does not have primitive operations on vectors you're in a world of hurt

if a rectangle was a record holding two vectors, then referring to the left side of a rectangle would be a very clumsy expression box.pos.x  vs. the simpler box.left.  I agree that once you use x and y you might be thinking of the center point, however in all systems i am aware of that use upper left corner of the screen as the origin, the first coordinate of a rectangle is the upper left corner. That dates back to Apple's Quickdraw, which used .left, .top, .width, and .height, although one could in Object Pascal and Modula-2 via a fixed length structure like this interchangably as a point of xy and a record of h and v, or whatever you notation pleased you. Untagged record variants was in those languages.

It's also worth consider how often you need to work with object centers rather than the corner of their AABB. I find I mostly work with centers, so I actually prefer top/left because that's unambiguous. Saying x/y could mean the corner point, or the center point, or an origin point / center of rotation.<br/><br/>Also agree with Wouter — Rects are best represented as pairs of vectors.

Both options are pretty bad :slightly_smiling_face: From a graphics programming pov, you want <tt>struct Rect { vec2 pos; vec2 size; }</tt> (or equivalent in your language), that way you can keep most computations to work on whole vectors at once. Repeating code for x &amp; y (and w/h) separately leads to very clumsy code.

okay at the 11th hour, asking for community opinion on the name of the fundamental structure that holds a rectangle. using rectangles is extremely common in graphics programming, and the original Apple Quickdraw rectangle was .left .top, .width, .height. I could even go as far as making it .x .y, .h .v, but .width and .height are more readable. The point is already with a record name a_xy, with fields .x .y<br/><br/>Seems slightly more consistent to make the rectangle .x .y .width .height

Currently  it is a_rect with fields left, top, width, height, but it could be shortened to a_box with fields x,y, width, height. This would also affect draw_rect and solve_rect which would then become draw_box and solve_box. It saves about 0.2% typing."  "a_rect" "a_box"

Hi everyone. I've got a blog post about my last release of Mech. I released back in June but I've been too busy enjoying the summer to write about it, and just got the chance. I'm already well on my way toward releasing the next version, but I thought I would detail the features in this current release so the next blog post won't be too long: <a href="http://mech-lang.org/#/blog/2019-06-12-docs.mec">http://mech-lang.org/#/blog/2019-06-12-docs.mec</a>

Hi all, here’s my take on visual coding: <a href="http://flowcode.kwaia.com">flowcode.kwaia.com</a>. A work in progress, with an early September demo release in sight. At this point you can explore the structure of an example program. (The demo of an SPA rendering engine.)<br/>The goal is to create a general purpose visual code editor geared towards touch devices, with a focus on usability and aesthetics. Also, with the use of a couple of standard libraries, to help developers build fast, robust, and secure apps.

:satellite_antenna: I had the pleasure of guest-hosting the most recent episode of the Future of Coding podcast — an interview with Berlin-based Lisp programmer Jack Rusher. I invite you to listen here [<a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041">https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041</a>] or in your podcast player of choice.<br/><br/>Topics: Scheme and Racket and Clojure (oh my), the minimalist but powerful literate editor <a href="https://maria.cloud">https://maria.cloud</a>, practical lessons about presentation and <em>feel</em> that programming tool authors can learn from video games and creative coders (like Devine Lu Linvega), a bit about typing disciplines and model checking, graphic design principles, visual programming, and some of our favourite papers.<br/><br/>Enjoy, do let me know what you think. This is my first time (ever) making a podcast, so I'm sure I've still got a lot to learn.

seems kinda neat, the Dark project is about server side stuff, be sure to see what they are up to. Tools like this really simplify what can be a daunting configuration task.

Hey, I've been working on a language to specify serverless systems and I just started playing around with making it visual.  Would love some feedback on these mocks.  The goal of Strat is to specify how your code packages talk to each other in the cloud without specifying infrastructure details, then the Strat compiler builds out your infra for you.  The textual representation (which would be isomorphic with the visual one) can be seen here: <a href="https://strat.world">https://strat.world</a>.  The biggest delta between Strat and other visual languages is Strat doesn't care about computation; it lets other programming languages handle that domain.

Hi guys, we are proud to reveal <a href="http://nodes.io">http://nodes.io</a> - a new way to create with code. We have been working together with <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nick Nikolov</span> on Nodes at Variable (<a href="http://variable.io">http://variable.io</a>) since 2017. We use it to create interactive installations, visualise data, experiment with generative algorithms, build custom design tools and more. We are currently looking for feedback here, or drop us a line at <a href="mailto:hello@nodes.io">hello@nodes.io</a> if you want to know more.

Hey all, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Dev Doshi</span> and I have been playing around with the idea of making popular specifications (like OpenAPI, infrastructure as code tools, etc) into programs instead of giant yaml files. The work makes it really easy to create projectional editors on top of these standards. I think more and more of the systems we build will eventually be specified declaratively and systems like the ones we describe can help usher in some new approaches to old problems. Let us know what you think<br/><a href="https://link.medium.com/KmdpsyrT9X">https://link.medium.com/KmdpsyrT9X</a>

Hi all, I’ve been working on a new language, with the main aim of trying to simplify UI development, from a FRP/denotative perspective (I believe, I’m not super strong on compsci theory so don’t know the precise definitions!), and the broader goal of trying to help minimise the coder/non-coder divide.<br/><br/>I hope it’s interesting, and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!<br/><br/><a href="https://maraca-lang.org">https://maraca-lang.org</a>

And please vote your preference for the data type pattern or regexp. If you allow a value to be a regular expression (which uses a novel syntax), should the data type be called regexp or pattern? Pattern seems friendlier, but it bumps into people's expectations that a pattern might be a bitmap.

Please vote your preference:  should a designator type in the language be called a path or ptr?  In some sense in a graph database world, you start with a root node, and proceed through refinement to a location via subscripting or field names, so  g.players[3].health is the path to a value, traditionally it was called a pointer. So which should it be, path or ptr?

Yes, I like how you set the point of vue on the programming experience first! For me it is the starting point for proposing new tool/language for programming. And I like the way you focus on the hierarchy of intents.

=====<br/>Another thought on this topic:<br/>There is a hierarchy of code interaction with decreasing frequency:<br/><br/>1. Reading<br/>2. Patches (e.g. change a string)<br/>3. Minor changes (e.g. write a function)<br/>4. Major changes (e.g. restructure code)<br/>5. Create a new project<br/><br/>  And I think code editors should be optimized for this interaction pattern.

Hi folks!<br/><br/>I developed following webapp a few years ago and although I was (and still am) quite excited about the possibilities, I never released it. I couldn't imagine the programming community at large get excited about it. Also I was sick of preaching things nobody else seems to care about.<br/><br/>But now that I discovered this community, maybe a few of you might like it:<br/><br/><a href="https://syvis.surge.sh/ErZoPhsMTcDvGT9pZswo/">https://syvis.surge.sh/ErZoPhsMTcDvGT9pZswo/</a><br/>Feel free to try it out with other JavaScript code. It completely runs in your Browser!<br/><br/>My thought process was that -- despite their flaws -- text editors are a quite powerful input method once you mastered the keyboard.<br/>Consuming / investigating code in a text editor, however, not so. Our syntax highlighting, code style guides, indentation based code, etc. are just a desperate attempt to mitigate this.<br/><br/>What if coding was more like writing a LaTeX paper? The LaTeX code is good to build the document, and for reviewing and distributing it, the rendered PDF is much better suited.<br/><br/>Next steps could be:<br/><br/>- Custom themes, so that you can render the code to you liking<br/>- Enable interactive editing for minor things like changing a number or a  string, reordering parts, …<br/><br/>Here is another abstract from a slightly different angle:<br/><br/>In most programming languages<br/>the semantic meaning of a program is disconnected from<br/>the formatting of the code and the naming of variables and keywords.<br/>This means semantically equivalent code can be written in a vastly<br/>different textual representations.<br/>This poses problems in terms of readability and understandability<br/>of code.<br/>Even minor modifications of punctuation or formatting in comparison to<br/>a developers familiar style can drastically decrease the performance.<br/>In order to mitigate these problems I propose to visualize code<br/>in a graphical and deterministic way.<br/>Instead of relying on the author of the code to format it in a acceptable<br/>manner, each developer can choose a visualization of their liking.<br/>This has the potential to decrease the error rate and<br/>increase the development speed of programmers.<br/><br/>Looking foward to you feedback! :grin:

Hi everyone. I've made some progress on Mech documentation I wanted to share here. Mostly I've done work on the rendering of Mech documents, so I've just started with writing the actual documentation. It's rough and incomplete now, but I was hoping for some feedback on the docs layout.<br/><br/>Here's a good example of a page that shows off most of the features:<br/><a href="http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/docs/programs/blocks.mec">http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/docs/programs/blocks.mec</a><br/>Here is the raw text:<br/><a href="https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/docs-page/raw/master/public/docs/programs/blocks.mec">https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/docs-page/raw/master/public/docs/programs/blocks.mec</a><br/><br/>Couple of features:<br/>-You can render a view under a block by writing to the block/view table. The syntax is subject to -change.<br/>-You can embed a Mech value in text with double square brackets. <tt>[[]]</tt><br/>-You can click on any table in a block to see a table inspector with the contents rendered in a nice layout<br/><br/>Here's an example of a function reference:<br/><a href="http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/docs/math/sin.mec">http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/docs/math/sin.mec</a><br/><br/>Here's an example of an error:<br/><a href="http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/examples/error.mec">http://docs.mech-lang.org/#/examples/error.mec</a><br/><br/>Hoping for any feedback you might have before I go back to writing the actual documentation. Thanks!

When you say 'trace', do you mean 'backtrace' (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace</a>)? It doesn't seem congruent with your definition:<br/><br/>&gt; the linking of your code’s runtime behavior to the higher level abstractions you used when writing it.<br/><br/>That's just debugging information? Not as important an idea, I think.<br/><br/>The word 'trace' means very different things in the JIT world, or in the microprocessor design world, or in the Lisp world.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Lol at the vulnerability as one of the primitives of today's software. It looks like the section is mistitled and you mean "vulnerability management". But I prefer the title to the contents of that section :smile:

You mention some of the tools/techniques that have been used, but it would have been more complete and accurate if you started with the first debugging tool after tracing was the crash dump, then checkpoint/restart appeared, then breakpoint debugging, then postmortem debugging (Modula-2, via the Logitech Multiscope debugger was the first commercial tool to offer this, where you could see all the data structures and stack trace on a crashed program from a customer), then omniscient debugging which is creeping into tools, which has been popping in and out of view for the last 15 years with greater frequency.<br/><br/>The exact origin of each of these tools and techniques can always be debated, but there is a clearly in our history a progression towards greater information, and omniscient debugging, (which includes time traveling features, plus data structure visualizations) are definitely going to be common in the future.<br/><br/>I disagree that Docker is some kind of progress. It is merely a patch over the atrocious lack of integrity checking in the archaic dynamic linking methodology of Unix, which is 50 years old, and long past expiration date. Because you can break things terribly with a new version of a shared library, Docker creates a half-assed virtual machine that lets two program needing different versions of shared libraries run at the same time on a machine. The fact that the version conflicts exist, and that old versions of a library are not updated (leaving security holes galore) cannot be considered an acceptable long term solution.<br/><br/>And if i can put on my grump-meister helmet, i frankly think that API's are the main evil of today's programming world, and must be eliminated. The future is a  world of interchangeable parts, not tens of thousands of API's, which have to be called in some specific order, and have mysterious interactions.<br/><br/>And version control systems which lets people break stuff constantly as they do in many open source projects have to evolve so that breakage is less common. The sad truth is that all the open source projects don't seem to have any external or built-in QA, so the code oscillates badly, with a good vintage of a project hard to pin down.

I just got through <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Shalabh</span>'s "Programmable Systems Series", and it does an excellent job of laying out what a lot of us are after in terms of reinventing software &amp; programming &amp; systems. Lots of fresh perspective and great links to other related resources and examples.<br/><br/>If you haven't read this already, go take a look! Each article is small to medium, and flows very nicely.<br/><br/><a href="https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/">https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/</a>

Hi everyone. I'm proud to release v0.0.1 of Mech today, the first of many. It's more of a test-run to figure out how releases will work, so documentation will come with the next release v0.0.2. Still, I figured some people here might be interested to read a blog post and play with a little robot arm I wrote in Mech. Let me know any feedback you have! <a href="http://mech-lang.org">http://mech-lang.org</a> and try it out online here <a href="http://try.mech-lang.org">try.mech-lang.org</a>

Hi <a href="!channel">!channel</a>. Anybody here interested in simplifying version control?<br/><br/>The other day I was trying to get some non-programmers to use github for collaborative work on mostly text documents and realized git is really a huge hurdle. So I've been thinking about how version control could be simplified and have a couple of ideas.<br/><br/>Is anybody here interested in that topic and in sparring with me on it a bit?<br/><br/>Also: do you know of any projects trying to simplify version control? I've found in ungit and gitless so far.

Am conducting a survey about a syntax preference. Option A is to make line comments use the C convention double slash (//). Option B is to make line comments use the '#' character. It is less characters, but a harder character to type. What is the opinion of this group?

Swift has some really crazy complex super subtle syntax features that i can't even imagine why they bothered because they take more effort to learn than they must save. All part of the committee approach that Swift has adopted, which is the PL/1 or ADA of our time. A gigantic language that just couldn't say "no" to any feature anyone could think of. PL/1 was great, and so is Swift, but it isn't easy for other people to make a Swift compiler, so it is more or less locked-in to Apple.

If some language has a built-in function called flurb(), you can always just create a runtime function that does that function on the other language. But structural issues, name scoping, and tricky closures and nesting of symbols can be hard to remap between languages. As a long time user of Modula-2 i could convert M2 to many other languages very easily because it is actually very simple. Always easier to map from a simple language into a more complex one (like Swift for example), but a nightmare to go from a complex one like Swift into say Pascal or Python.

Don't get me wrong; if you can find two languages whose naming systems are similar enough it should work okay. But if you try to map a language with deeply nested naming systems into one that has far fewer levels, it gets very thorny.

The Loyc structure works okay, but where it will break down in terms of offering language translateability is that the real problem with language conversion is not the operators; those are typically fairly straightforward to parse:  a + b means the + operator with two operands.The killer problem is all the symbol table gyrations that come up, with all the subtle context switches. For example, you have a static global named x, a field in a record named x, a local variable named x, and the compiler is tracking a very complex web of inheritance chains to figure out which x you mean at any one time. Your conversion program would need to disambiguate the names. In my current work more than 50% of the total effort of the compiler is tracking all the symbol information. In inferred type languages, where the programmer doesn't have to specify explicitly the type, but it is inferred through various means, it gets extremely difficult to nail down the type, but one must of course do this to remap the code. So although the goal of your project is laudable, i believe it will become impossible, else you would be implementing a compiler for each language, just to map it to another. If two languages are similar enough the mapping can go one way pretty easily but to go bidirectionally between a wide variety of languages would be a massive and quite difficult task.

I tweeted this recently: <a href="https://twitter.com/stathissideris/status/1099322082905808896">https://twitter.com/stathissideris/status/1099322082905808896</a> - it’s about my efforts to query the Clojure AST using datalog from the REPL. The same system also supports querying information about the actual invocations of functions and the data that was passed to them, so eventually you’d have a hybrid static/dynamic analysis. It’s still at the proof of concept stage so I think it hasn’t realized its full potential, but I’d be interested about what you think about it.

So i think that makes sense if you’re not approaching it from a commercial point of view. We’re taking a fiercely pragmatic approach, which is that devs are gatekeepers and fashion forward leaders for this type of tech (that is, one that can be used to solve broad existing problems)

just don't think you can start there and end up with non-coders using it.

When working on visionary systems or systems designed for experts, the academic publishing review process can sometimes be brutal. Reviewers sometimes expect user studies, but complex systems, particularly systems built for experts, cannot be compared head-to-head with prior work in 1-2hr user study sessions—fluency with a <em>tool</em> could require 6 months practice or more! How then do you show that the system you’ve built is actually an improvement, if you can’t perform traditional human testing on it? In 2007, Dan Olsen addressed this problem, identifying the common reviewer mistakes (“Evaluation Errors”), outlining a framework for justifying the contribution of a complex system (“STU Context”), and offering possible claims a paper could make in leu of human usability tests. To help me keep track of these ideas, I pulled them into a one-page summary. I hope others find this summary helpful as well.

Hey everyone. I've been quiet for a while, but I finally have something to show for my time working on my language Mech the last couple of months. Last I showed it off here I had a video demo of a bouncing balls program. Shortly after that video I tore everything out and made a more realistic runtime. After about 4 months of work I'm back to where I was then, feature wise, but now the foundation is more stable and you can actually play with it in the browser:<br/><br/><a href="http://mech-lang.gitlab.io/try/">http://mech-lang.gitlab.io/try/</a><br/><br/>Click compile and the bouncing ball program compiles. Then click start timer to set the balls in motion. You can click in the canvas area to add more balls. Click pause to stop them. Step forward and back moves through the transaction history.<br/><br/>I don't really have a user guide done yet, but I have a list of expression that I know work, so you can get an idea of what's possible from this: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/syntax/blob/master/tests/compiler.rs">https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/syntax/blob/master/tests/compiler.rs</a><br/><br/>The main idea is that each block of code reads from or writes to a set of global tables, denoted by hashtags. When all the input to a block is available, that block will execute the operations defined therein, and then writes data out to the global tables with a set operator <tt>:=</tt>. Blocks re-execute every time its inputs change, providing a reactive, live feel. You can also gate a block's execution on a specific column with the <tt>~</tt> operator, which will cause a block to run <em>only</em> if the associated column changes.<br/><br/>Right now, there are a ton of language features I haven't implemented yet. What I have implemented are basic math, operators, some inequality operators, logic operators, table construction syntax, and indexing operators. I'd like to make sure these operators are rock solid before I move on to anything else. I'm hoping some intrepid people here can test drive what I have now to find cases that don't work. For now, you can see program output in the Chrome console by clicking on "View Core". If you find any code that explodes or produces unexpected output, please let me know by filing an issue here: <a href="https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/issues">https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/issues</a>

I am submitting a paper to SNAPL 2019 (<a href="https://snapl.org/2019/">https://snapl.org/2019/</a>) about the design of the PL course I taught at Stanford. My goal is for readers to come away understanding the rationale for how I designed the course, why I believe that it’s a good idea, and that the initial trials have been successful. Would love to get feedback on anything that is unclear or unjustified.

I posted this random thought about Immediate Mode GUIs vs Retained Mode GUIs<br/><br/><a href="https://games.greggman.com/game/imgui-future/">https://games.greggman.com/game/imgui-future/</a><br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure this is directly relevant to this slack's topic but it's at least tangentially relevant in that a GUI system that is an order of a magnitude faster opens certain possibilities that slow GUI systems either preclude or require extreme effort to overcome.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

Alrighty, I need the rubber to hit the road: My editor is still in a bit of a rough shape, but I'd really appreciate getting some early feedback:<br/>The basic idea is having a code editor that's fairly close to the text based editors we have atm but that uses more contextual information to make every keypress more meaningful . "Every" being the eventual goal, in its current state the right word would be "Some".<br/>Similar to my previous project, Snytactor, it's atm only a JS editor. Supported syntax currently includes: declarations, arrays, objects, arrow functions (somewhat), function calls &amp; if/for statements. Happy to get comments / bug reports / ideas or even PRs :upside_down_face:<br/><a href="https://gregoor.github.io/tofu/">https://gregoor.github.io/tofu/</a>

As many of you know, I'm obsessed with original-Conal-Elliott FRP. It took be forever to understand it, so I've balked at trying to explain it to others.<br/><br/>Last week, <span style="background-color:#ccf">@Jonathan Edwards</span> convinced me to spend some real time on an essay to explain it. I just finished draft 1. (So please don't share around on social media just yet.)<br/><br/><a href="https://futureofcoding.org/drafts/dctp">https://futureofcoding.org/drafts/dctp</a><br/><br/>The essay was written for people who already like ReactJS and functional programming, and maybe even have some Haskell experience.<br/><br/>It's at least a 20-minute read, so give it a go when you get a chance. No rush. At this stage, I'm looking for birds-eye-view feedback. Do you follow the overall argument arc? If not, where do you fall through the cracks? Does the tone work for you or is it too informal?<br/><br/>Really appreciate anyone taking the time to review and give feedback. This piece is important to me :heart:

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@David Lee</span> Thanks! It's currently decoupled from JS so you can render any language or really any strings you want. React/JSX is only in TS/JS so you're stuck with that for defining the generators.

We've been exploring ways to make our code generation tools easier to customize in the next version. Right now it only renders but we can apply our code diffing at some point to roundtrip code...there's something really interesting when you slam all these concepts together.

Hello everyone, At Postman (<a href="http://getpostman.com">getpostman.com</a>), we are thinking of a flow-based programming DSL + UI language to help people build API Workflows. The discussion is going on here in our issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5707">https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5707</a>. I’d love to know your thoughts regarding the typical reservations that programmers have towards UI based tools. Some of them are in the comments in the issue I referenced. Postman has millions of people today that we feel will benefit from the ability to program workflows quickly but want to make sure that we end up building the right thing.

Hi all, I’m building a non-linear reactive document for the masses! And it’s called “AfterClass”. AfterClass is right now is specifically for founders of early stage startups who want to save time and money by automating every day repetitive tasks connected with their documents, like sending and keeping track of invoices, or asking the team for updates and logging those in a document, or even automatically pulling data from your other apps (Google Analytics, Quickbooks, etc) and compiling a weekly report and sending it to your email.<br/><br/>I like to think of it as “Zapier meets Google Docs”<br/><br/>My end goal is to create a dynamic digital medium that is more tied in with the real world by means of being non-linear and reactive, as opposed to static and linear documents.<br/><br/>I am aware that this is a massive problem, but here’s step one — <a href="https://afterclass.co">https://afterclass.co</a><br/><br/>I’d be happy to hear your feedback and comments

Something small I’m working on, a tool for interactively editing, moving and resizing React components. Still very much a work-in-progress. Uses recast+babel for transforming code, is based on component-playground and relies on interact.js for resizing. <a href="http://www.simplicitydesign.fi/demo/toystore/">http://www.simplicitydesign.fi/demo/toystore/</a>

Hey all, as a proof-of-concept for a larger explorative research direction I had, I made a plugin for Sublime Text that turns your code into an interactive tree, using the AST-nodes as branches. By hovering over the branches in the visualization, the corresponding node gets selected in your editor. Take a look, and let me know your thoughts!<br/><br/><a href="https://martijnbrekelmans.com/gifs/constructor-ast.mp4">https://martijnbrekelmans.com/gifs/constructor-ast.mp4</a>

Looking for comments, opinions on an idea I've been thinking about, described here : <a href="http://sdi.thoughtstorms.info/?p=1344">http://sdi.thoughtstorms.info/?p=1344</a><br/><br/>Something we could call "Assemblage Programming"<br/><br/>Does this make sense? Can anyone see anything wrong with this idea? Is there a language out there that actually works like this?<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to build a prototype of this. But what would people recommend as the compile target? I'd quite like a very simple, prototype-based OO virtual machine. Maybe that is just Javascript. Or maybe something else. Anyone know of a good, high-level overview of what a Smalltalk or minimal OO VM architecture looks like?

It's a prototype live, functional programming environment centered around data-visibility – all intermediate values are visible by default, and you construct a program by acting on these values. Please take a look, and let me know if you have any thoughts.

Hey all -- We've gotten super focussed on using Optic to auto-document APIs and then provide autocomplete and compile-time feedback for API Requests. I think we can remove most of the friction between getting systems to communicate if systems are able to negotiate these more sophisticated contracts on their own w/o the need for humans or documentation.<br/><br/>I've gotten to see a ton of backends the last month as we've been pivoting to this new use case and I stumbled upon a really interesting trend in larger codebases: there's no one way to model data types.<br/><br/>One team was using Scala on the backend and they had case classes that represented each of their models, JSON Schemas for validation, MongoDB schemas to setup their tables and Play JSON schema validators that ran on the request body. On the JS frontends they had Ducktypes for each model, in Typescript they had interfaces, and on iOS they were using Swift Classes for each model. Oh and they maintain a Swagger Spec &amp; Raml Spec which duplicates all of this again...<br/><br/>That's at least 8 different representations of essentially the same information. Some of the differences affect syntax, like in JSON Schema it's <tt>type: 'string'</tt> while Ducktypes are <tt>type: String</tt>. Others are more functional -- like in MongoDB there's a notion of indices that are important for the domain of databases, but that's not important for the purposes of validating an object so folks like JSON Schema don't support it.<br/><br/>Anyway they had 44 models so imagine the wasted time and headache. This whole thing came up because we were setting up Optic to read their backend and I had to ask which one of these representations was supposed to be the source of truth.<br/><br/>Curious if A) you see this as a problem and B) how you might go about solving it. Hope this spawns some interesting ideas here.

Nicely written. Reminded me of the daily challenge we face of finding that sweet spot in programming between hacking and over-engineering. Enough structure to be useful now and in the future - not too much, not too little

Hey everyone! Recently I realized that human is an ultimate interface for programming language design.<br/>I'm working on a draft of the article that describes an interesting idea:<br/><a href="http://vladimir-vg.me/p/0c9d65f4-7cd3-40cb-83f1-a964f7076ccf/">http://vladimir-vg.me/p/0c9d65f4-7cd3-40cb-83f1-a964f7076ccf/</a><br/><br/>I would love to hear your feedback, any ideas that come to your mind after reading this.

Simple question with interesting implications: Do you think the next big programming language/paradigm that becomes mainstream will be written in itself (bootstrapped)?

New feature, "change time travel" (undo).<br/><br/>Slide through changes and see how they behave on current data.<br/><br/>It can be combined with tracing and input time travel to see how it behaves on previous data.<br/><br/>Any entry can be recovered and used as current.

Hey all -- I spent a lot of time the last few months thinking about how to make it easier to connect applications together. I think with the advent of microservices and the abundance of 3rd party APIs for just about everything has created a need to make it easier to automatically connect software.<br/><br/>I wrote up this abstract this morning for a programming language that'd make this easier out of the box -- it's probably not super novel but I thought I'd share. Thanks in advance for feedback. I'm not at all possessive of this idea so feel free to remix the best parts if you want :slightly_smiling_face:  <a href="https://gist.github.com/acunniffe/031caf85261a790b7406e1c0f5658605">https://gist.github.com/acunniffe/031caf85261a790b7406e1c0f5658605</a>

I've recently come up with a new framing for my work. It's still in a rough state, but here's my first shot at writing it out. Would really appreciate the criticisms of this community. Is it compelling? Too idealistic? How does it differ from your own vision for the future? Thanks! <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/log#new-framing-customization-conversation">https://futureofcoding.org/log#new-framing-customization-conversation</a>

When I, or others, say they want to reinvent “programming,” a next thought is: how much of programming? The diversity of computational tasks is rather large. I’ve attempted to build my own diagram of the centers where human motivations and technical concerns tend to simultaneously cluster. (The central “computer” is not a cluster, but a representation of the ubiquitous cross-cutting tooling). If anyone has any knowledge of pre-existing “taxonomies” of computer science, or any thoughts on the diagram, I’d be happy to hear it.

Good news!! Last night I was emailed by Amjad from <a href="http://Repl.it">Repl.it</a> about sponsoring my podcast. For starters, he’s interested in paying for transcripts of episodes, which has been widely requested. I’d be curious for thoughts about how to handle the sponsorship without being intrusive or annoying. My first thought was that somewhere in each episode I’d thank them for their sponsorship and explain in a couple of sentences what they do. Thoughts?

I'm working on an intellectual genealogy of sorts of people like Papert, Kay, Victor, etc. I'd appreciate feedback on it either in the form of comments or by editing the graph directly and sharing your new link. I worry that this is the sort of project may offend people (as it is a simplification, putting people in a "box" so to speak) so I'd appreciate thoughts on how to mitigate that<br/><br/><a href="https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiXG5ncmFwaCBURFxuIFxuUGlhZ2V0W0plYW4gUGlhZ2V0XS0tPlBhcGVydFxuUGFwZXJ0W1NleW1vdXIgUGFwZXJ0XS0tPktheVxuTWNMdWhhbltNYXJzaGFsIE1jTHVoYW5dLS0-S2F5XG5LYXlbQWxhbiBLYXldLS0-VmljdG9yXG5UdWZ0ZVtFZHdhcmQgVHVmdGVdLS0-VmljdG9yXG5kaVNlc3NhW0FuZGkgZGlTZXNzYV0tLT5WaWN0b3JcblBhcGVydC0tPmRpU2Vzc2FcbkhvZnN0YWRlcltEb3VnbGFzIEhvZnN0YWRlcl0tLT5WaWN0b3JcbkVuZ2VsYmFydFtEb3VnbGFzIEVuZ2VsYmFydF0tLT5LYXlcbk1pbnNreVtNYXJ2aW4gTWluc2t5XS0tPktheVxuU3V0aGVybGFuZFtJdmFuIFN1dGhlcmxhbmRdLS0-S2F5XG5CcnVubmVyW0plcm9tZSBCcnVubmVyXS0tPktheVxuS2F5LS0-SGFydFtWaSBIYXJ0XVxuVmljdG9yW0JyZXQgVmljdG9yXS0tPkNhc2VbTmlja3kgQ2FzZV1cblZpY3Rvci0tPlBhdGVsW0FtaXQgUGF0ZWxdXG5WaWN0b3ItLT5HcmFuZ2VyW0NocmlzIEdyYW5nZXJdXG5CdXNoW1Zhbm5ldmFyIEJ1c2hdLS0-RW5nZWxiYXJ0XG5CdXNoLS0-TmVsc29uW1RlZCBOZWxzb25dXG5CdXNoLS0-TGlja2xpZGVyW0ouIEMuUi4gTGlja2xpZGVyXVxuTGlja2xpZGVyLS0-U3V0aGVybGFuZFxuU3V0aGVybGFuZC0tPkVuZ2VsYmFydFxuQnVzaC0tPlN1dGhlcmxhbmRcbktheS0tPkpvYnNbU3RldmUgSm9ic10iLCJtZXJtYWlkIjp7InRoZW1lIjoiZGVmYXVsdCJ9fQ">https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiXG5ncmFwaCBURFxuIFxuUGlhZ2V0W0plYW4gUGlhZ2V0XS0tPlBhcGVydFxuUGFwZXJ0W1NleW1vdXIgUGFwZXJ0XS0tPktheVxuTWNMdWhhbltNYXJzaGFsIE1jTHVoYW5dLS0-S2F5XG5LYXlbQWxhbiBLYXldLS0-VmljdG9yXG5UdWZ0ZVtFZHdhcmQgVHVmdGVdLS0-VmljdG9yXG5kaVNlc3NhW0FuZGkgZGlTZXNzYV0tLT5WaWN0b3JcblBhcGVydC0tPmRpU2Vzc2FcbkhvZnN0YWRlcltEb3VnbGFzIEhvZnN0YWRlcl0tLT5WaWN0b3JcbkVuZ2VsYmFydFtEb3VnbGFzIEVuZ2VsYmFydF0tLT5LYXlcbk1pbnNreVtNYXJ2aW4gTWluc2t5XS0tPktheVxuU3V0aGVybGFuZFtJdmFuIFN1dGhlcmxhbmRdLS0-S2F5XG5CcnVubmVyW0plcm9tZSBCcnVubmVyXS0tPktheVxuS2F5LS0-SGFydFtWaSBIYXJ0XVxuVmljdG9yW0JyZXQgVmljdG9yXS0tPkNhc2VbTmlja3kgQ2FzZV1cblZpY3Rvci0tPlBhdGVsW0FtaXQgUGF0ZWxdXG5WaWN0b3ItLT5HcmFuZ2VyW0NocmlzIEdyYW5nZXJdXG5CdXNoW1Zhbm5ldmFyIEJ1c2hdLS0-RW5nZWxiYXJ0XG5CdXNoLS0-TmVsc29uW1RlZCBOZWxzb25dXG5CdXNoLS0-TGlja2xpZGVyW0ouIEMuUi4gTGlja2xpZGVyXVxuTGlja2xpZGVyLS0-U3V0aGVybGFuZFxuU3V0aGVybGFuZC0tPkVuZ2VsYmFydFxuQnVzaC0tPlN1dGhlcmxhbmRcbktheS0tPkpvYnNbU3RldmUgSm9ic10iLCJtZXJtYWlkIjp7InRoZW1lIjoiZGVmYXVsdCJ9fQ</a>

Hello everyone <a href="!here">!here</a>,<br/><br/>I have something I would love to hear your feedback on: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFe9E5_P44&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLwia5ezffHz7GLSDx27yxHn4ueIct4j9u">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFe9E5_P44&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLwia5ezffHz7GLSDx27yxHn4ueIct4j9u</a><br/><br/>I'm interested in any thoughts you have but mostly:<br/>- is the video/sound quality sufficient or annoyingly bad?<br/>- did you feel like you could follow along or was it confusing?<br/>- would you be interested in the next demo?<br/><br/>Thanks a lot for taking the time :smiley:
