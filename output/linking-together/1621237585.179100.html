The 2021 edition of <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/">HotOS</a> (hot topics in operating systems) program was just wrapped up (conference is in a week or so). This paper on Aurora, an experimental single level store, seemed like it would be interesting for this audience:<br/>&gt; We present the Aurora single level store (SLS), an OS that simplifies persistence by automatically persisting all traditionally ephemeral application state. With recent storage hardware like NVMe SSDs and NVDIMMs, Aurora is able to continuously checkpoint entire applications with millisecond granularity.<br/><a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s07-tsalapatis.pdf">https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s07-tsalapatis.pdf</a>
