In related news, this was on HN yesterday. We like to talk about the "future" of coding, but from my experience, a lot of the ideas we talk about can be found in the "past" of coding like in the synchronous languages mentioned here: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18141375">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18141375</a>

Absolutely, there are many ideas from the past that may not have been not explored fully. Rather, effort was spent on optimizing ideas that caught on. The proverb that comes to mind is "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few."<br/><br/>The link above mentions Ceu, which is a (recent, but) very interesting language (<a href="http://www.ceu-lang.org/">http://www.ceu-lang.org/</a>).
