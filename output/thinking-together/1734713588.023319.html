I have been working with large-ish knowledge graphs on and off over the course of the year, and I keep running into the same problem... my intuition for what I have done when I modify the graph and how it will effect everything else is just dismally bad. I make what seems like will be an incremental change, and it doesn't do what I expected, or if it does, it breaks all my algorithms. This happens with other data structures, too, obviously. But with graph data it happens far more often, as in nearly always, and the time between "it isn't working" and "oh, I know how I broke it" is much longer. So I'm wondering, assuming that my experience is not unique, is there something about graphs that makes them harder to grok? The absence of a clear serialization, the absence of order, complexity of structure? Or is it a UI problem, and if I could just see what I was doing it wouldn't be so bad... Often, when I come to a particularly hard problem, I sample and visualize the graph, and learn that the previous three problems were not correctly solved. So visualization helps, but is that enough? Or is there something fundamentally inhuman about large, dense graphs?

In general, maybe? Like I have at least twice added edges of a different type to reflect a different relationship, and failed to appreciate the need to exclude those edges from how other algorithms in the system work, because the new edges represent relationships of a different type. And that mess-up has been invisible to me until I was investigating why steps far after that algorithm was applied were broken. But that's just one example, and it's not about the specifics. It's a pattern I'm beginning to see, and I wonder if it represents something, or if it's just the effects of a leaning curve, or what.

In my experience, even linked lists are hard like that. It doesn’t seem like the problem goes away until you eliminate edges entirely and have arrays.

In trees whose shape mirrors the shape of the recursive computation exactly, things can be simple. Thinking locally works.

"working with <b>knowledge</b> graphs" makes it sound like you are clicking away in some notetaking™ UI, and not programmatically modifying particular data structure.<br/><br/>if "mistakes while programmatically modifying" is the case – it is similar to working with dynamic (python/clojure) vs static (java/haskel) lang codebase: you know the general rules "how to call method on thing/get attribute of thing", but dynamic-lang env (generally) hits you with "that thing has no such method/attribute" at runtime, static (generally) – at compile/IDE time.<br/><br/>maybe it can be generalized as: there are rules either 1) you are unaware of, or 2) are not enforced "in time"<br/>(whatever "enforced" and "in time" mean for you, eg. red squiggly line in IDE, or absence of method in autocomplete dropdown, etc.)

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@misha</span>, the problem is not using the library. The problem is that after I do something using the library, the representation in my head of what the output will be and how it will behave elsewhere in the code is dramatically wrong.

<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Nilesh Trivedi</span> thanks for the Hillel link. I'm a fan of his and hadn't seen it before. But again, that's addressing bad libraries.. The problem I'm describing is with me.

But I wonder if this isn't the same category of problem that strict typing is supposed to solve, where it detects for you when the shape you are expecting is not the shape that will arrive. But some of the properties that I would need to specify would be across wide portions of the graph, at arbitrary levels of complexity. I could define two OWL ontologies, and use reasoners to validate the before and after versions of the graph data. But that seems like a nightmarish level of overhead. Pydantic for graphs, maybe. :sweat_smile:
