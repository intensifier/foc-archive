This is really important to us, because one of the problems we had in Bitsquid/Stingray was that we spent <em>a lot</em> of time on developing UI and tools. Sometimes we would spend 30 minutes to add a feature to the runtime and then a week to create a UI for it. In The Machinery we wanted to address that imbalance and make sure that we could write tool and UI code as efficiently as runtime code.<br/><a href="https://ourmachinery.com/writing-tools-faster.html">https://ourmachinery.com/writing-tools-faster.html</a><br/><br/>&gt; <b>How Do We Fix it?</b><br/>&gt; Automate undo, copy/paste, etc with a well-defined data model<br/>&gt; Less busy-work<br/>&gt; Minimize and own the tech stack<br/>&gt; Make things explicit and easy to understand<br/>&gt; Avoid changing frameworks<br/>&gt; Control performance<br/>&gt; Reuse UIs and generate them automatically from data<br/>&gt; Properties, Tree, Graph, etc<br/>&gt; Don't have to create an UI for everything.
