Hey all, when I was on the podcast in Feb I talked about our plans for Optic's sync feature. Sync monitors your entire codebase and when you make a change to a source of truth in your code (like the definition of a model), it can generate a pull request that updates all the code that depends on it. We just finished building it and its shipping in the net release. Here's a video preview for you all &amp; a link to a blog post/source code
