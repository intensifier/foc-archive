hey <a href="!everyone">!everyone</a> steve and I are trying to get an estimate on attendance for the meeting on 8/7 since we might get a room on breather depending on the size/what people want to do (or if someone has access to a space we can use somewhere relatively central...I think most people are downtown).  ground support cafe is still an option, but last time we met at starbucks and ended up being pretty loud for a decent sized group to have a conversation/find seats
