<span style="background-color:#ccf">@magicmouse94937</span> I agree with what you said, however what I'm trying to do here is find an existing formalization of these kinds of complicated state machines. Labelled Transition Systems are apparently exactly that, for programs that have a finite set of states (bounded memory use / non-recursive data types). Symbolic Transition Systems appear to handle infinite-state programs. Academics have taken these systems and built programming languages on top of them (such as the class of languages called "process calculi" or "process algebras"). We might be able to learn something from these languages.
