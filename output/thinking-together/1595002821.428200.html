I was contemplating if this is something for #general or if it should go into #meta, but the more I think about it, the more I believe this is as much about the future of coding as it gets; at least about the future of coding that I want to see.<br/><br/>Here's the always well-read and deeply investigative Dan Luu about discrimination in tech:<br/> <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/</a>

&gt; Q: Could biological differences in motives — motivational patterns that evolved in the Pleistocene but that apply to us today — propel more men than women towards careers in mathematics and science?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A: My feeling is that where we stand now, we cannot evaluate this claim. It may be true, but as long as the forces of discrimination and biased perceptions affect people so pervasively, we’ll never know. I think the only way we can find out is to do one more experiment. We should allow all of the evidence that men and women have equal cognitive capacity, to permeate through society. We should allow people to evaluate children in relation to their actual capacities, rather than one’s sense of what their capacities ought to be, given their gender. Then we can see, as those boys and girls grow up, whether different inner voices pull them in different directions. I don’t know what the findings of that experiment will be. But I do hope that some future generation of children gets to find out.<br/><a href="https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html">https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html</a>
