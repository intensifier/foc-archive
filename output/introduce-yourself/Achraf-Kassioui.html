Hi!<br/><br/>Consider a 3D animated character. How to build one such that it moves by itself? Then, how to make it such as it becomes a proxy for you to express your emotions and experiences, as quickly as possible, with as little indirection as possible?<br/><br/>My interest in programming and computer as a medium comes from these first set of questions. My name is Achraf ("ash-rough"), I live in Morocco, and I have a background in visual arts, philosophy, and cognitive science. I worked in 3D visualization, web programming, and user interface design. More info on my website: <a href="https://www.achrafkassioui.com/">https://www.achrafkassioui.com/</a><br/><br/>I follow a lot of people in this group. Kudos to all of you who share and communicate your work.
