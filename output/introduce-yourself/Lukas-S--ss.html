<b>What brought me to the future of programming space ...</b><br/><br/>Hi, I am Lukas M Süss (aka mechadense)<br/><br/>I guess for me my path to "future of coding" relevant topics was initially kicked off many years ago (2005 maybe?) when stumbling across a german website with name "C-hater in 10 days".<br/>Before I already had banged my head into the limitations of current day programing languages again and again.<br/>• First in the context of game programming, <br/>• and later in the context of 3D modelling.<br/><b>That was revelation one.</b><br/><em>Here the (german) page in the internetarchive:</em> <br/><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.uni-bremen.de:80/~thielema/CHater.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20080612103719/http://www.math.uni-bremen.de:80/~thielema/CHater.html</a> )</em> <br/><br/>This eventually led me to taking a course about the haskell programming language and the theory behind it. What I learnd there was quite eye opening and <b>my second revelation.</b><br/>_The (german) course: <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2122.html</a> — by Jens Knoop — at TU Vienna_<br/><br/>At some point when I came across diagramming sofware (then I used yEd) I sketched out all of what I've learned so far. Thereby realizing …<br/>• (A) … how far even Haskell is still improvable. — <b>Revelation three.</b><br/>• (B) … how much can be learned by high level diagramming and how awesome it would be if that would fall out of a programming language<br/>I was starting to desire autopropagarion of renaiming, automatic code substitutions, and more … Desiring structured editing — basically.<br/><br/>My <b>fourth revelation</b> was making the connection between John Tromps Lambda diagrams and textual code, leading to my work on "Annotated Lambda Diagrams (ALDs)".<br/>-- _<a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram">http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Annotated_lambda_diagram</a>_<br/>I found that translating existing ideas into these diagrams greatly helps me in understanding them. Which makes me think that this may be a good "semitextual" programming interface.<br/>Now I'm in the process of investigating ideas-and-work of some great people in the context of ALDs ( Looking at ideas from: Conal Elliott, Jonathan Edwards, Cryus Omar <a href="http://et.al">et.al</a>. , Daniel P. Friedman, ... ) All this as spare time efforts.<br/><br/>My <b>fifth and so far final revelation</b> (during 2018) emergerd probably mostly from my frustration with nonexistence …<br/>• … of local-first selfhosting options.<br/>• … of personal local-first self-owned content curation assistents.<br/>I realized that in order for good novel technical solutions of core problems to thrive sociotechnical problems need to be solved in unison <em>(unison the word not unison the proglang here)</em>. Code just cannot be borderlessly shared if there are no well designed means that allow for judement of its trustworthyness.<br/>What I want to see eventually are distributed ledgers that:<br/>• do not insist on maximally global public consensus for everything and <br/>• are nonmonetary at their core.<br/>Very few projects aim for that. In fact I only know one so far.<br/><br/>— — —<br/><br/><b>Regarding the "future of coding" side of my interests I'm into:</b> <br/>• denotative core language design<br/>• content adressed design (datastorage and versioning)<br/>• dependent typing <br/>• agent centric design (sociotechnical aspect)<br/>• and what I missed here ...<br/>My core interest though is actually advanced atomically precise manufacturing (APM). Aimed at future gemstome-metamaterial-on-chip-factories. But if software does not get fixed I see a dark future ahead. Both for the path there and the eventual result.
