<span style="background-color:#ccf">@Brendan Zabarauskas</span> something about dependent types feels icky to me.  It's taken reflection over years, but it boils down to principle typing being a sweet spot where you can ask what is <b>the</b> type of an expression.  Knowing additional properties is nice, but there's finesse: what additional type information is relevant for a given task.  For example, within a library you really want to know that data-structure invariants are maintained, but as the user of the library you're happy to ignore those details.
