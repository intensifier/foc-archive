There are seemingly innocuous design choices in everyday programming languages that make simple tasks hard. For example, in JS, you can't actually ask what the state of a user's mouse is. It's physically impossible. Instead, you have to subscribe to events about changes in mouse state, and then record that event information to use later. This design choice alone would likely prove a serious barrier to laypeople trying to write certain mouse-based apps. What discipline and principles do we need to apply to ensure we avoid these design errors in our end-user programming systems?
